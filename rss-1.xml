So, I thought it would make sense to provide more detail and clarity on my thinking on this important box in what will be the 1st piece in my Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights series. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6b1a" name="6b1a">While many observers don’t actually see the choice of management systems as part of strategy itself but rather a lesser choice, I see management systems choice otherwise, as integral to the practice of high-quality strategy. It is positioned at the bottom of the cascade only because the logic starts from the upper left and flows to the lower right. However, the flow goes both ways so no box is really at the start or finish. Great management system choices help confirm that the logic also flows from management systems back up to winning aspiration.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2cf1" name="2cf1">In this way it is an important reality check on the distinctiveness of strategy. A company needs <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">management systems</em> that build and maintain the distinctive <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">capabilities</em> that underpin a unique <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">how to win </em>in the chosen <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">where to play</em> that meets its <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">winning aspiration</em>. If a strategy does not have specific management systems that serve the purpose of building and maintaining distinctive capabilities, then those capabilities either won’t get built in the first place or will deteriorate because they are not systematically maintained. Additionally, if the capabilities and management systems of an organization are entirely or nearly identical to those of competitors, its where-to-play and how-to-win choices will be replicated as soon as shown to be successful. Hence distinctiveness is a key attribute to management systems. Sameness in management systems is typically matched with sameness in capabilities which delivers competitive parity not competitive advantage.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e686" name="e686">That having been said, every company has numerous management systems. It has an order-entry system, a system for putting together its regulatory filings, a system for announcing new executive appointments, a capital appropriations system, etc. For that reason, simply creating a list of all of a company’s management systems is not a useful part of a strategy exercise. The key is to make and enumerate management systems choices that are disproportionate, novel and notable compared to competitors and linked to building distinctive capabilities for the company. However, since the key distinctive capabilities of a given company’s strategy vary widely across companies and their strategies over time, it is not possible or sensible to specify which are generically good management systems. The key to great management systems is their individual match with the distinctive capability.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a0ac" name="a0ac">The two pieces of useful guidance I can provide, therefore, on management systems, are a categorization framework and a range of examples of each. I have found that management systems that provide competitive advantage by building and maintaining distinctive capabilities fit into three categories: they drive disproportionate resource investment, they specify novel allocation of decision rights and/or obligations, or they mandate unusual measurement or tracking of information.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="e714" name="e714"><img class="graf-image" data-height="1078" data-image-id="1*l3iGH7VKCF_ycduZJROW_A.png" data-width="1922" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*l3iGH7VKCF_ycduZJROW_A.png"/></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="b206" name="b206">I provide a number of examples of each below.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="db0e" name="db0e"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Management Systems that Drive Disproportionate Resource Investment</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0c26" name="0c26">The first category contains the management systems that drive the disproportionate resource investment that is required to build and maintain a distinctive capability, which is critical to winning.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8223" name="8223"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Four Seasons Hotels &amp; Resorts</em> seeks to win with a kind of service that is unique and that needs to be carried out by experienced Four Seasons hotel staff (as opposed to hotel staff experienced at other hotels), but in an industry that experiences 60–70% annual turnover. To get this kind of experienced hotel staff, Four Seasons has a management system that drives disproportionately huge investment in recruiting/hiring. To be hired, a recruit needs to have three successful in-person interviews, the last of which is with the hotel manager. This would be an unthinkably large expenditure of resources for other hotels, but sensible and necessary for Four Seasons desired capability. This management system is rigorously enforced and adhered to. In addition, its career development system is disproportionately invested in because after recruiting the very best, Four Seasons wants and needs to keep them for a long career, which it does with turnover below 10%.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="64c2" name="64c2"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Progressive Insurance</em> seeks to win, in part, by getting settlements to its customers so quickly that lawyers don’t get into the middle of the process because Progressive knows that on average when a lawyer is involved, it costs Progressive more and the customer gets less due to the high fees charged by the lawyer. In order to be in a financial position to pay claims quickly, Progressive has a management system for its investment portfolio that invests disproportionately in short-term liquidity at the cost of earning higher investment returns.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d22b" name="d22b"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Southwest Airlines </em>seeks to win by having an extremely efficient cost structure while providing outstanding customer service. A key aspect of its cost efficiency is a uniquely high level of flexibility in what employees can do in a specific situation. They are cross-trained and can surge to where they are needed, which makes for much more efficient staff utilization than experienced by its competitors. But this means that its management system for labor negotiations entails not negotiating hard on salary but rather investing in high salaries in order to gain — as a negotiating trade-off — the much more important — and unique — labor flexibility.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b866" name="b866"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">WestRock</em>, the paper packaging giant, follows a differentiation strategy of being the premier partner and unrivaled provider of winning packaging solutions. That means, among other things, having a management system that compensates its salesforce disproportionately highly for selling differentiated packaging solutions, not just generic volume of packaging.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="17b4" name="17b4"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Mabin School</em>, a uniquely differentiated elementary school, illustrates disproportionate investment in a non-profit context. Its philosophy holds that it admits a family, not just the child. Hence, it invests heavily in family engagement in order to succeed with its unique approach to elementary education. That means having a system in place that guides teachers and administrators in making a disproportionate investment of time with parents during the admissions process, the entire educational process and the process of gaining placement into the next educational level.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6cc0" name="6cc0"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Management Systems that Specify Novel Allocation of Decision Rights and/or Obligations</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d420" name="d420">The second category contains the management systems that specify novel allocations of both decision rights and decision obligations that are required to build and maintain a distinctive capability that is critical to winning.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6fda" name="6fda"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Four Seasons Hotels &amp; Resorts, </em>as mentioned above, differentiates on the basis of a consistently high level of service in an environment in which there are millions of touch-points per year between staff and guests. Because quick resolution of guest problems as they occur is a key to high-quality service, the company has a management system that pushes down the decision rights on fixing customer service problems directly to frontline workers. If staff members see a path to resolution that they think will work, they don’t have to check with a supervisor before taking action.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7cee" name="7cee"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Progressive Insurance</em>, as described above, differentiates itself, in part, by getting more cash to customers by cutting out the lawyer as ‘middle man.’ That entails having a management system that empowers mobile Progressive claims-people to make settlement decisions and cut checks for customers at accident sites rather than having to go through a time-consuming head-office claims processing ritual.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b5d0" name="b5d0"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Procter &amp; Gamble</em> seeks to differentiate on the basis of technologically superior products backed by compelling brand building. To ensure this comes to fruition, P&amp;G enforces a decision-making obligation on its managers to perform and win in a statistically-robust blind test for potential new products before they are approved for any launch decision. In addition, it enforces a decision-making obligation to perform similarly robust advertising copy testing before releasing it for public use. For both product blind tests and advertising copy testing, there is a clear and formal management system to be followed.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8538" name="8538"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Procter &amp; Gamble (Hair Care) </em>sought, beginning in 2016, to reestablish unquestioned global leadership in the hair care category. A challenge for the category at the time was a bias toward making decisions entirely based on quantitative data. Since the category has many non-technical consumer needs (emotional/phycological) that are difficult to measure quantitatively, the Beauty Care President mandated a decision-making obligation to incorporate both quantitative and qualitative data and insights into every hair care strategy decision.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3b6b" name="3b6b"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Management Systems that Mandate Non-Standard Measurement/Tracking of Information</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="59d5" name="59d5">The third category contains the management systems that mandate non-standard measurement and tracking of information.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d62d" name="d62d"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Four Seasons Hotels &amp; Resorts, </em>as mentioned above, seeks to further its service differentiation by quickly and thoroughly resolving all guest service problems before the guest checks out of the property. In order to ensure this is the case, it mandates that every hotel in the chain thoroughly deploys its ‘glitch reporting &amp; service recovery system.’ The system provides encouragement and reward for all staff members to report any guest service glitch that they observe — even if they were the cause of it. All such glitches are captured on the ‘glitch report,’ which is reviewed each morning by the hotel staff. The group then creates an individualized service recovery plan to make sure that all guests who experienced service glitches feel as good or better about Four Seasons service when they check out as when they checked in.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cc7a" name="cc7a"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Progressive Insurance</em>, in addition to winning on the basis of getting bigger settlements to customers faster, seeks to win on the basis of more effective underwriting based on a huge database that enables it to create tens of thousands of pricing categories based on many more risk variables than its competitors. To build and maintain that database, it has a management system that mandates the ongoing collection and processing of a volume and breadth of data that exceeds industry practices and standards.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ee7c" name="ee7c"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">WestRock, </em>which as mentioned above, seeks to differentiate based on providing uniquely-valuable packaging solutions. In order to judge whether it is doing so, or not, WestRock mandates a management system for measuring whether it is helping customers do one or more of the four following value-adding things: lower their total costs, grow their sales, reduce their risk, and/or improve their sustainability.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f0cf" name="f0cf"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Procter &amp; Gamble, </em>when CEO AG Lafley took the helm in 2000, switched its basis for determining incentive compensation from market total shareholder return (M-TSR) to operating TSR (O-TSR). M-TSR, which measures performance based primarily based on movements in the company’s stock price, is the standard measure used across public companies. But it has the effect of encouraging management teams to focus on short-term fluctuations in stock price and the drivers thereof rather than on the long-term performance of the company, which O-TSR more closely measures by focusing on sales growth, profitability and cash conversion.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f0ad" name="f0ad"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Summary Thoughts</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b54f" name="b54f">Management Systems may be the fifth and final box on the strategy choice cascade but not because it is unimportant. It is positioned there because that is where it logically belongs. But it is as important to competitive advantage as any other box. The key is that the management systems help the cascade flow back consistently back to the top.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="fde5" name="fde5">There are no generically superior management systems. Strategically strong management systems are those that help build and maintain the distinctive capabilities that underpin company advantage. Distinctive management systems that are disproportionate, novel and non-standard in the areas of resource allocation, decision rights and measurement are the key to making sure that strategies are real and powerful.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

<description>Playing to Win Is the Opposite of Your Choice Stupid on its Face? If it is, it is not Really a Strategy Choice I ask one question when I try to assess whether a choice is a real and powerful strategy </description>

I am dedicating my 2nd Playing to Win Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece to Is the Opposite of Your Strategy Choice Stupid on its Face?(Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c31f" name="c31f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">It isn’t a Strategy Choice</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6146" name="6146">We have all seen countless strategic plans asserting that the organization’s strategy is to be ‘customer-centric’ or to be ‘operationally effective’ or to ‘invest in its talent.’ But these don’t meet my test for strategic choices — even though they may actually be the most frequently proffered choices in the world of strategic plans. My test for whether a stated choice is actually a strategic choice is whether or not the opposite of the choice is stupid on its face.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="681d" name="681d">For example, the opposite of the choice to be customer-centric is to ignore customers entirely, which is stupid on its face. Only a regulated monopoly — like the Department of Motor Vehicles — can ignore its customers entirely and survive. Similarly, either being operationally pathetic or disinvesting in talent is also stupid on its face. The only positive thing that can be said about those choices is that they aren’t stupid. And as such, you can be highly confident that all your consequential competitors will be making that same choice — i.e. to be customer-centric, operationally effective and to invest in their talent.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="255c" name="255c">Since strategy is the act of making distinctive choices that position your organization uniquely to win, by definition a choice the opposite of which is stupid on its face is not a strategy choice. That does not mean it is a bad choice — just not a strategy choice. The opposite of filing your corporate tax returns on time is stupid on its face; but you better file your corporate tax returns on time or you are in big trouble. Organizations have to make innumerable choices where the opposite is stupid on its face, they just aren’t choices that rise to the level of a strategy choice. They are necessary to compete but don’t enable you to win.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="04ee" name="04ee"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Value of Making Strategy Choices</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c34c" name="c34c">When an organization makes a choice for which the opposite is not stupid — and in fact a competitor is doing the opposite and succeeding — it has the possibility of having distinctive strategy. Some other competitors might be making a similar choice, so it isn’t by definition distinctive; but at least it will place your organization in a smaller competitive set. The goal, of course, is a competitive set of one with a fully distinctive choice.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="77fe" name="77fe">Think of mutual fund giant Vanguard. When Jack Bogle founded Vanguard, he made a choice to offer only passively managed index mutual funds (and later index exchange-traded funds). The opposite was to offer actively managed mutual funds, which wasn’t stupid on its face. It was what every other fund company on the planet chose, including Fidelity, which is the other global giant in the industry. Vanguard definitively made a strategy choice because the opposite was a successful strategy for Fidelity and others. In fact, arguably, Vanguard helped make Fidelity’s choice to compete as active management provider a real strategy choice because it proved that the opposite was anything but stupid on its face. Fidelity then had to make other strategy choices to separate itself from the pack of other active management mutual fund providers.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4c36" name="4c36">Vanguard and Fidelity illustrate the value of making real strategy choices. Consider who benefits from the making of real strategy choices. Customers do. They get variety of offerings. If they believe Vanguard founder, Jack Bogle, that fund managers don’t pay for their costs in terms of enhanced returns, then they can invest in a Vanguard fund. If they believe Fidelity founder, Ned Johnson, that fund managers are critical to providing exceptional returns of the specific sort desired by the investor, then they can invest in a Fidelity fund. Shareholders do. The Johnson family is one of the richest families in the world thanks to the growth and success of Fidelity. Bogle set up Vanguard as a mutual company, so fund investors have benefited from the success of Vanguard. Employees do. Both companies have grown continuously from the time of inception to nearly 70,000 employees between them today. Communities do. Valley Forge, PA and Boston, MA are thrilled to have Vanguard and Fidelity in their jurisdiction, creating jobs and paying taxes.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="763a" name="763a">In this way, real strategy choices make the world a better place: they are good for customers, shareholders, employees and communities.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e5ed" name="e5ed"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Downside of Not Making Real Strategy Choices</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b5fe" name="b5fe">When organizations fail to make real strategy choices, they make the world a worse place. This happens when competitors in an industry begin to imagine that there is only one set of choices that make sense for their industry — essentially believing that the opposite of that dominant set of choices is stupid on its face. When most or all converge on that set of choices, the industry commoditizes. Think of the PC industry when it converged on selling Wintel boxes, or when the large US airline carriers converged on identical service and operations models, or when the Big 8 accounting firms converged on nearly identical auditing models, or now the smartphone industry converging on phones based on the Android operating system. These industries (or substantial parts of them) commoditize because with similar choices, the competitors produce an output that looks and feels nearly identical for customers. And when customers feel that way, they look for the lowest price from any one of the competitors.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d3dd" name="d3dd">With commoditization comes less customer choice, downward pressure on profits, and downward pressure on all costs, including wages. It makes it is less attractive place for customers, shareholders and employees — and often the communities in which they operate and work.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="70c4" name="70c4">Of course, the convergence on a set of non-strategic choices provides a great opportunity for others to utilize that bland backdrop to forge a distinctive strategy, like Vanguard creating an entirely new and now gigantic category of index funds or Southwest entering the US scheduled air service industry with a completely different model and becoming the most successful airline in the industry. In other cases, one player, as with Apple in personal computers and smartphones, keeps making a distinctive set of strategy choices in the face of the entire rest of the industry coalescing on one set of choices — and by staying distinctive prospers disproportionately.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="189d" name="189d"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">But Isn’t it Good to be Customer-Centric?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1b0a" name="1b0a">When I say that being customer-centric isn’t a strategy choice, people always ask: but you write all about design and deep user understanding, isn’t that a contradiction? It is not; in fact, these ideas are complementary. Customer-centricity is stated at level of generality that makes both the opposite stupid on its face and negates the value of deep user understanding. It is only a strategic choice to be customer-centric in a way that is distinctive from the way competitors are being customer-centric. That means pushing customer-centricity to a much more specific level — and that is a key strategy choice discipline.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="63df" name="63df">For example, in the luxury hotel category, all the successful competitors are customer-centric — guest-centric in their nomenclature. It is not at all distinctive to be guest-centric; it is a necessary feature of playing in the luxury hotel space. But for most luxury hotel chains, the guest-centricity is manifested in grand architecture and décor as well as what could be characterized as obsequious service (Yes sir, yes madame, whatever you want). In contrast, at Four Seasons, whose deep guest understanding found that they would rather be at home or at the office than in yet another hotel room, and thus features a guest environment designed to make up for what the guest misses from being home or at the office. Here the choice is pushed to a level of specificity that the opposite (grand architecture and décor) is not stupid on its face: rather, it is common among competitors.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0ddd" name="0ddd">P&amp;G is not distinctive because it has chosen to invest in talent. Many of its competitors also do. But it is distinctive because it has chosen a promote-from-within system that enables a distinctive form of investment in its talent.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="33b3" name="33b3">Southwest is not distinctive because it has chosen to pursue operational effectiveness. Virtually all of its competitors pursue it in some form. But it is distinctive because it has made myriad operational choices (one kind of aircraft, no seat selection, point-to-point route structures, cross-trained staff, etc.) that are utterly distinctive.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c9b6" name="c9b6"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Practitioner Insight</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="67c4" name="67c4">Test every prototype choice with the question: is the opposite stupid on its face? If the answer is yes, then chances are that the choice is stated at such a level of generality that it isn’t a powerful choice at all. If that is the case, drive the choice to a greater and greater level of specificity until such time as you can say with confidence that the opposite is not stupid on its face: in fact, somebody else is doing the opposite successfully. Then you will have made a real strategy choice.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

That is why my 3rd Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights piece is on Why I am Skeptical of Low Market Shares. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d045" name="d045">The low purported share may be factual based on the company’s generic definition of the market in which it operates. But I don’t take 8% share or 11% share or 17% share as helpful in any strategic sense. A company should have a definition of market share that helps it grow. These low shares don’t help, even though the sentiment is typically that with only 8% share, there are 92 points-of-share available, so growth opportunities are virtually limitless.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a11a" name="a11a">For the market in question to be validly defined and the 8% share to be a representative measure, the company needs to compete for all customers and compel 8 of every 100 customers for which it actively competes to choose it over the other competitors. Typically, when I take a closer look at where and how a low-share company competes, I find that it doesn’t compete in any way for at least half the supposed customers. Many customers actually buy a product (service) with distinctly different attributes, or they are served by a different distribution channel, or they are in a different geography. In fact, I find that the company’s share is actually over 20% of the customers who have a realistic chance of buying from it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d078" name="d078">I also look at the question in reverse — from the customer angle. If the company actually has an 8% share in the eyes of all customers, then every customer is actively considering about a dozen suppliers in making the choice. In both B2B and B2C, very few customers actually consider a dozen suppliers when making a choice — whether of a shampoo, SUV, cellular service, bottling machine or accounting service. They actively consider a handful — which is consistent with companies having true shares above 20%.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9850" name="9850"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why Does it Matter?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="34df" name="34df">It matters because I have rarely seen a company that both describes its current share as under 20% (let’s stick with the 8% share) and acts consistently with that belief, actually improve that share tangibly. When they think that 92 share-points are out there for the taking if they would just keep trying what they are currently doing, they tend to diffuse their marketing and sales efforts and not appeal powerfully to anyone in those 92 seemingly available share-points. As a result, I tend to find that small share positions remain small share positions, even though they appear to embody awesome growth opportunities.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="4a09" name="4a09"><img class="graf-image" data-height="405" data-image-id="1*f35sgx6w6sdRIpft9oVhpw.png" data-width="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*f35sgx6w6sdRIpft9oVhpw.png"/></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="0412" name="0412">Worse, the negatives compound themselves. In addition to having a very diffused marketing and sales effort at the 92% non-customers, who really wants to join a company that sees itself as an 8% player? And who wants to be the supplier to or distributor of an 8% player? Others in the ecosystem will adopt the company’s own attitude and see it as an inconsequential company in that big market and will prefer to align themselves with the bigger player(s). This effect makes it doubly hard to grow out of the low share.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0549" name="0549"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Superior Alternative</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3d49" name="3d49">The superior alternative is to be more disciplined in defining the box in which you actually compete. What customers are buying a product (service) with your general set of attributes, in the general range of your price point, served (if relevant) by distribution channels you use, in a geography in which you operate? Right now, for your strategy, that is ‘the market.’ Share of anything else is effectively zero and right now, is not relevant to your progress.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9877" name="9877">Make sure that your share of that market is 20% or higher, so you have a consequential position. If it is not higher than 20%, go back to the box and tighten it some more. While this may seem artificial, it isn’t. Companies just don’t have fractional shares of big markets — they just think that they do.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9c35" name="9c35">When you have defined your market share as 20+%, your job is to fine-tune your strategy for and focus your selling effort on that market and that market alone. This will force you to focus on winning, not on participating, the latter being de facto the case for companies with fractional shares. The job is to achieve a 50% or greater share of that market as narrowly defined.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="61ff" name="61ff">You will be, by definition, winning if you have more than 50% market share because your relative market share (RMS) will be greater than 1.0 (RMS is your market share relative to the biggest competitor in the market other than you. If it above 1.0, you are the leader; if it is below, a competitor is). Then, to those who want to work in that industry, you will be the attractive winner to work for. You will be the highest-volume supplier for the distribution channel. You will be the biggest volume purchaser of supplied inputs. Net, you will be a winner that is worthy of their attention.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f4c4" name="f4c4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Next Step</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4d58" name="4d58">When you have deployed this strategy to transform from a loser to a winner, you are set up to take the next step: to broaden.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="6d87" name="6d87"><img class="graf-image" data-height="405" data-image-id="1*xAMFjCOP2QUMjFG_oh0JRg.png" data-width="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xAMFjCOP2QUMjFG_oh0JRg.png"/></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="71a3" name="71a3">Determine the adjacent Where-to-Play that is most attractive based on your capabilities and broaden to it, with the goal of attempting to achieve a leading market share within five to at most ten years. If that goal and timing seems unachievable, then pick a more tightly defined adjacent WTP. Again, the task is to win not to play. Having an RMS of less than 1.0 in the defined WTP ten years out implies that you are definitively losing. And the core rule is that playing to lose breeds more losing, while playing to win breeds more winning.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dcc6" name="dcc6">Often, customers drag winners into new WTPs, which is by far the easiest way to tackle a new WTP. Think of smartphones as a new WTP for Apple in 2007. Loyal Apple customers begged Apple to enter the smartphone business and lined up around blocks for a chance to buy the iPhone when launched. The advanced enthusiasm for the iPhone enabled Apple to strike an extremely favorable exclusive distribution deal with AT&amp;T. It also enabled Apple to have the confidence to launch at substantial scale. Winning where Apple previously chose to play enabled Apple to have a leg up in winning in this new WTP.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ff6b" name="ff6b">And sometimes, the initially small total addressable market (TAM) grows because of your nurturing of it. Neither Google nor Facebook entered a large TAM. They both created (or entered — depending on how you want to define those markets) initially small TAMs (search-based advertising and social media-based advertising) that have grown continuously and explosively into giant TAMs. Why do Google and Facebook dominate those giant TAMs today? It is because they never sought or accepted a fractional share of these markets.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0546" name="0546"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insight</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="2950" name="2950">Never define yourself as a small player in a big TAM and don’t spend your time chasing big TAMs. They are a trap. Playing to play in a giant existing TAM — like ‘services,’ ‘US healthcare,’ or ‘China’ — is a trap. Participating as a small share player in a large TAM is a recipe for pursuing a weak and diffuse strategy against bigger players, which is a recipe for losing and then losing more in a downward spiral. Instead, focus first on winning in a smaller TAM and once you are a winner there, then broaden from a position of strength, not of weakness.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Martin, 2020</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="4d0f" name="4d0f">This is the 4th in my Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights series and it is on Strategy is what you DO not what you Say. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7bd8" name="7bd8">In his research on interpersonal behavior patterns, the late management scholar Chris Argyris, noted that there is often a dramatic difference between what people say they are doing and what they actually do. He called the former, Espoused Theory and the latter Theory-in-Use. For example, a person’s Espoused Theory could be that “I always listen carefully before offering my opinion.” However, if the person’s behavior is observed, the Theory-in-Use might actually be that the person listens only if the other person is saying something agreeable and cuts the other off if he or she heads in a contrarian direction. Argyris pointed out that this sort of disjuncture between Espoused Theory and Theory-in-Use renders individuals much less effective in accomplishing their goals and, sadly, incapable of figuring out how to learn and improve.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9d1b" name="9d1b">I see the same schism between Espoused Theory and Theory-in-Use in strategy with similarly deleterious effects. The schism comes in two basic flavors.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f403" name="f403"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Flavor #1: Tough Guys/Gals Don’t Do Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a0e3" name="a0e3">Many executives who pride themselves on being practically or operationally focused will claim that they don’t do strategy or don’t have a strategy because they are focused what is truly important: operations/execution. They will often declare that after they have finished dealing with the pressing execution issues, they will turn their minds to strategy — which in my experience they never do because by their definition, there will always be a pressing execution/operational issue. These executives see strategy as conceptual and theoretical — for process-oriented MBA types — not for tough-minded and practical executives like themselves, who just operate and get stuff done! This is often the case with entrepreneurs who will claim that they don’t do strategy at all and have no intention to do so. They just do what their gut tells them, so there is no need for a strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c376" name="c376"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Flavor #2: Strategy as Fantasy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4152" name="4152">Others hold strategy to be centrally important and have extremely lofty statements of their strategy. They typically have a majestic statement of vision/mission/aspiration — “We are the most transformational force in our entire industry, bringing new value to customers and blazing a trail to the future.” These statements also typically include decisive competitive advantages — “We are superior to all competition in providing value to our customers who reward us with the highest level of loyalty in the industry.” These statements tend to be incorporated into thick strategic planning documents and find their ways onto posters on walls and Lucite blocks on desks. Executives of these organizations go out of their way to tell others about their company’s magnificent strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7c16" name="7c16"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">It is Not What You Say…</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fd54" name="fd54">I would argue that for both flavors, the assertion is neither correct nor helpful to the company in question. Strategy is choice — this set of five choices, with the Where-to-Play (WTP) and How-to-Win (HTW) choices as the heart of strategy.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="62e8" name="62e8"><img class="graf-image" data-height="405" data-image-id="1*C2DgaKcI4LTYgqC0pneLag.png" data-width="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*C2DgaKcI4LTYgqC0pneLag.png"/></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="3d6b" name="3d6b">The companies led by execution-focused executives play in some places and not others — their WTP. They compete (and maybe win, but maybe not) in some way(s) and not others — their HTW. In addition, they have an observable set of Capabilities that enable them to compete in the way that they compete, where they compete. And they have a set of Management Systems that have caused them to settle on investing in those Capabilities. And from those four choices, one can infer what their Aspiration really is. Their Espoused Strategy is that they don’t have a strategy — but their Strategy-in-Use is the product of the choices they have made.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4880" name="4880">For the companies with strategy as fantasy, one can look to see whether what they say is reflected in the outcomes they experience. Typically, the Aspiration is utterly unfulfilled. The WTP may be accurate, but the HTW (however stated) is delusional and neither the necessary Capabilities nor Management Systems are to be found. Their strategy is an Espoused Strategy not their Strategy-in-Use.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ca10" name="ca10">Though for different reasons, in both cases, there is a wide gulf between their Espoused Strategy and their Strategy-in-Use.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="07f1" name="07f1"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">…It is What You Do</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a52f" name="a52f">For all companies — including these two flavors — your current strategy is what you do, which is the cumulation of the choices that you have made to this point in time. All your previous choices have produced your current WTP. All your previous choices have produced your current HTW. All your previous choices have produced the set of Capabilities you now have and have shaped the Management Systems that guide you. And all your current WTP, HTW, Capabilities and Management Systems define what your Aspiration actually is. In contrast to the Espoused Strategy, it is the Strategy-in-Use.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dbc4" name="dbc4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Problem with the Espoused Strategy/Strategy-in-Use Gap</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="da8f" name="da8f">A substantial gap between Espoused Strategy and Strategy-in-Use creates myriad problems. Those with strategy as fantasy are vulnerable to organizational cynicism. Staff will look at the lofty statement and compare it to what is really happening and come to see leadership as knowingly hypocritical, which undermines trust in leadership. These companies are also prone to surprisingly disappointing results because leadership tends to believe its own assertions and assume that the ‘strategy’ will produce far better results than it has any chance of doing. Further, that belief will typically result in delayed responses to systematically bad performance.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8572" name="8572">For those who see themselves as waiting to do strategy until they have tackled their execution challenges, their Strategy-in-Use becomes a cumulation of short-term fixes of pressing problems rather than a coherent and purposeful set of choices. The lack of such a purposeful set of choices is what causes the company to be beset by continuous ‘operational/executional challenges,’ which causes the leader to postpone tackling strategy again, which causes more challenges, which cases delay, and so on.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cc89" name="cc89">For those who claim to not have a strategy at all, mainly successful entrepreneurs, the degree to which the logic of the true strategy is buried deeply and implicitly in the head of the entrepreneur makes it extremely difficult to transition to the next generation of leadership. It is, of course, not the only reason for the well-documented problem of moving from entrepreneur to professional management, but I believe it is a significant contributing factor.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e1cb" name="e1cb">The biggest problem with a substantial gap between Espoused Strategy and Strategy-in-Use is that it is very difficult to improve your current position if you don’t know where you are today. If you want to get to Kansas City, it is sure important to know whether you are starting out from Boston or Los Angeles! If you want to improve from your current outcomes by improving your strategy, it is absolutely essential to know what your current strategy is. That has little or anything to do with what you say, it is a product of what you have done and are doing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d35d" name="d35d"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Practitioner Insight</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="70b7" name="70b7">For this reason, by far the most productive way to start work on strategy is to reverse engineer your current strategy. This means to enumerate how our choices to date have resulted in the current definition of 1) where we play (and here follow <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/an-idea/why-i-am-skeptical-of-low-market-shares-a65e65911dce" href="https://medium.com/an-idea/why-i-am-skeptical-of-low-market-shares-a65e65911dce" target="_blank">the advice of my previous PTW/PI</a>), 2) the current approach to how we compete, 3) the capabilities we have built and 4) the management systems that currently govern the way we operate. This assessment should not concern itself with any intent about the future because the goal of this exercise is to get a clear definition of the current Strategy-in-Use. The final step is to define what the answers to these four questions mean for our actual aspiration — not some lofty one, the one that would be most consistent with the answers to the four questions. If we play broadly, win nowhere, have capabilities that mirror those of competitors and management systems that reinforce the previous three answers, our aspiration is to be mediocre. If we were trying to be great, we wouldn’t have made those choices.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d2e6" name="d2e6">This can be an emotional exercise because participants will typically want to characterize their company’s strategy in a more positive, aspirational and future-oriented way. If they are unable to warm to the task, switch to first doing the exercise for your closest competitor. Attempt to reverse-engineer their WTP, HTW, Capabilities, Management Systems — and therefore infer their Aspiration. The group is likely to be able to do that exercise reasonably dispassionately. Then you can tell them to imagine they are actually the management team of that competitor and are tasked with doing the same exercise for your company. At that point, the group can typically tackle the reverse-engineering task productively.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="ee7d" name="ee7d">With an accurate description of your Strategy-in-Use in hand, you are ready to take the next step, which is to define the problem that needs to be solved by making improvements to this Strategy-in-Use — and that will be the subject of my next PTW/PI!</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Martin, 2020</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="cefc" name="cefc">This is my 5th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights piece and it is on Strategy as Problem Solving. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1896" name="1896">The thing I hate most about modern strategy is that it has become a regular corporate process: “It is (say) April, so we must develop a strategic plan to fit into the budgeting cycle and be presented to the Board in October.” The strategic planning process typically mandates a standard set of analyses, most often the centerpiece of which is a SWOT analysis. I often ask groups of managers whether they have both performed and reviewed a least one SWOT analysis in their careers — and 100% say they have. I then ask as a follow up: “Could you please share with me an example of a blinding new insight that you gained from either performing or reviewing a SWOT analysis?” The result is head-scratching and blank stares. I still haven’t gotten a single example of a memorable insight in a sample of thousands of SWOTs.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8eff" name="8eff">This is what standard strategy practice has become: an analytical exercise, backed by hundreds of pages of analysis, designed to produce a document that fits with the budget and provides the Board with a strategic plan for approval. No wonder most line executives see strategic planning and strategic plans as a colossal bureaucratic waste of time. For most they see strategy as the verbose and flowery prose that supplements the numbers in the budget. And I don’t disagree. Most strategic planning processes produce strategic plans that are not worth the effort put into them. This is why, even though I have spent a career as a strategist and love strategy, I generally hate both strategic planning and strategic plans.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4bf7" name="4bf7"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What Should Strategy Be?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5f51" name="5f51">Strategy should be a problem-solving technique. That is where its true value lies. Strategy is the act of making a new set of choices designed to solve a problem that was created by the interaction of the existing set of choices with the competitive environment. This means that strategy does not start at a particular time of year or with an esoteric and vague SWOT analysis. It starts with an identification of a gap between the aspirations of the organization and the current outcomes it is achieving. If there is no gap, it is a waste of time to do strategy: just keep doing what you are doing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="68ee" name="68ee">When I say that, I typically get the pushback that even if there is no gap, the organization should still do strategy to be proactive relative to a threat that has not yet visited itself upon the organization. I concur with the theory behind the sentiment: it would be nice for an organization to figure out threats before they occur. I just haven’t seen that happen in a strategy process that starts with the premise that there is no problem, but we should do strategy anyway. In my experience, there are always warning signs — which show up as a gap between aspirations and outcomes — before whatever shift that is imagined becomes ubiquitous. For example, in the 1980s, newspapers didn’t have to dream about a time in the future that on-line news and advertising would destroy their business models. All they had to check — as I did for a newspaper client in the mid-1980s — was the decrease in take-up of the habit of reading a daily newspaper by the then-sub-25-year-old demographic. If the aspiration was to maintain old readers and lose younger readers to an alternative habit, then there was no gap. But if newspapers wanted to have new readers when their older readers died off, the gap was obvious by 1985, a full 15 years before their economic models started to fall off a cliff.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6bc8" name="6bc8">If an organization actually pays attention to what its customers are doing, it will get plenty of warning signs about the need to make different choices. As science fiction writer William Gibson opined: “The future is already here — it is just not very evenly distributed.” If an organization waits until such time as a change is evenly distributed, it will almost certainly be too late to take bold strategic action and instead it will be doomed to fighting a painful rearguard action. Instead, it needs to ask as the motivator of strategy: “What customer actions are producing a gap between the aspirations we hold and the outcomes we are experiencing?”</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="9bbe" name="9bbe"><img class="graf-image" data-height="405" data-image-id="1*FkqTc4rgcv_7HqUhXZGbBg.png" data-width="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FkqTc4rgcv_7HqUhXZGbBg.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin, 2020</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="0f10" name="0f10">Have customers started to buy more from a traditional competitor than from us? Or have they switched to buying from a new entrant? Or are they embracing a substitute product/service and thereby shifting revenue from our industry to an adjacent one? Are they switching back and forth between providers more often? Are customers are doing one or more of the above, are they in one identifiable segment or a seemingly random slice of customers?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="519f" name="519f">Only if the problem is identified can we know whether a new set of choices has a plausible chance of solving the problem or not. If we don’t specify a problem, any set of choices is acceptable as a way forward. That is why strategy often feels very bland and unimportant: it doesn’t solve a meaningful pressing problem, so who cares? It is also why there are often so many intense arguments over which strategy to choose. Without a problem against which to judge the quality of a strategy choice, the choice simply becomes a matter of taste, and everybody is equally capable of making an argument for the strategy that fits their taste.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="396d" name="396d"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What if We Get the Problem Wrong?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5d76" name="5d76">A common objection to the problem-led approach to strategy is that we might get the problem wrong and hence the strategy will then be wrong too. I have two reactions to that concern. The first is that failing to make strategy a problem-solving exercise just returns us to the above set of shortcomings — so pick your poison. The second is that the problem definition will never be perfectly correct. Because it is not possible to accurately know everything about the strategic context in which you operate, your initial problem definition will always be wrong to some extent. The 1985 newspaper may have defined the problem as a slight decline in overall newspaper readership in the industry rather than a precipitous decline in readership by the youngest demographic if it hadn’t occurred to them that different age demographics might have different behavior patterns. But working on the problem of the negative impact of newspaper readership on its business would have eventually gotten that newspaper to a better definition of the problem as it worked on solving the problem.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3384" name="3384">And that is my fundamental answer to the concern. Start with a problem that is meaningful to you. But assume that it will be found to be less-than-perfectly-framed and adjust as you go — not just once but as often as it strikes you as valuable to do so. Think of strategy as a learning journey. The act of contemplating choices that could solve your problem, you will learn more. The newspaper company will eventually learn that older readers aren’t changing their readership patterns while new potential readers are not getting started with the newspaper habit — and that is the fundamental problem that they need to solve.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d1a0" name="d1a0"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is the Best Vehicle for Identifying the Problem?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="405c" name="405c">The very best way to identify the motivating problem is to talk to customers. Don’t do a quantitative survey — that is for much later in the strategy process when you need to test potential strategy choices. Start ethnographically with in-depth interviews of a smaller number of customers. In my experience, 10 to 20 customers will do. Interview some existing customers, some customers of your competitors, and some customers of substitutes (including the substitute of doing without — for dentistry, for example, the biggest substitute is not going to the dentist at all). Will customers tell you the problem you should be tackling? Rarely. But they will give you insights on the problem. For example, a small set of interviews told the 1985 newspaper that its slowly declining circulation was not because its readers were defecting to the competitor paper, it was because people were reading newspapers less, and it appeared that the lower readership trend was age-related. That insight provided management with a good problem with which to start its strategy exploration.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d112" name="d112"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What Must the Strategy Choice Accomplish?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4d4f" name="4d4f">To have been worthwhile, a strategy development effort most solve the identified problem. That is how to determine whether your strategy is sound: does it have a strong chance of making the strategy problem go away? Any possibility should be judged against this standard and the winning choice is the one that best solves the problem identified.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="67a1" name="67a1"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insight</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8f25" name="8f25">Strategy is first and foremost a problem-solving tool. A strategy process will be largely worthless without an identified problem that it is designed to solve. Remember that strategy problems start with the customer behaving in ways we wish that they wouldn’t. That is why the best way to define the problem to be solved is to do in-depth qualitative interviews with customers.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ccbe" name="ccbe">Don’t seek perfection on the initial problem definition. It will evolve as you go — and the evolution is not evidence of bad initial problem definition: it is evidence of productive learning. Embrace it. Review the problem definition often and ask: “Given what we know today and didn’t previously know, how would we improve our problem definition.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="a52c" name="a52c">Finally, judge your strategy choice against the standard of whether it will make the problem go away. Ask that question repeatedly to avoid a strategy that is interesting, maybe innovative, maybe bold, but doesn’t actually solve the problem identified.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Martin, 2020</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="4ea7" name="4ea7">Choices are the heartbeat of every organization. Progress happens only to the extent that people throughout the organization make choices. That is why I am dedicating my 6th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights piece to Strategic Choice Chartering. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4df2" name="4df2">While the convention is to label the choices at the top ‘strategic’ and those below ‘executional,’ I have found that distinction counter-productive, as I have pointed out <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2010/07/the-execution-trap" href="https://hbr.org/2010/07/the-execution-trap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in print</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/strategy-and-execution-are-the-same-thing" href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/strategy-and-execution-are-the-same-thing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on-line</a>. The paired Where-to-Play/How-to-Win choice is <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/strategic-choices-need-to-be-made-simultaneously-not-sequentially" href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/strategic-choices-need-to-be-made-simultaneously-not-sequentially" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the heart of strategy</a> and on that front, I don’t observe only the CEO of Procter &amp; Gamble making WTP/HTW choices. The President of Beauty Care also makes WTP/HTW choices, as does the Senior Vice-President of Hair Care, as does the Global Brand Franchise leader for Pantene, as does the US Brand Manager of Pantene. The same applies for service operations, such as Four Seasons Hotels &amp; Resorts, where I see the CEO, the President of Asia-Pacific, the Hotel Manager of Maldives Landaa Giraavaru, and even its Room Service Food Manager all making WTP/HTW choices.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="47fd" name="47fd">Hence, I see strategy choice as occurring throughout the organization, as illustrated in the diagram above. The CEO of P&amp;G does not make WTP/HTW choices for Pantene. And even the Maldives Hotel Manager can’t make the choice for the Room Service Food Manager when a guest makes an odd meal request — should the WTP be interpreted as ‘anything the guest wants to eat’ and the HTW as infinite customization, or is the WTP the adherence to a narrower menu range with a HTW on the basis of price/value and quick delivery?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="01de" name="01de">I have come to see that choices, like those for Pantene and Maldives Room Service, only get made well if there is diligent strategic choice chartering from the top of the organization on down. Unless you are at the absolutely lowest level of the organization, you have a key job of both making and chartering strategic choices. The CEO may initiate the process, but the making and chartering of choices must continue all the way down the hierarchy for effective action to take place.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c508" name="c508"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Elements of Strategic Choice Chartering</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1518" name="1518">There are six elements of successful strategic choice chartering throughout an organization — and as organizations gets bigger and more layered, chartering becomes ever more critical to success.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="8fa4" name="8fa4"><img class="graf-image" data-height="405" data-image-id="1*yTXDa6SR55YyDOC5ZbpfvA.png" data-width="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yTXDa6SR55YyDOC5ZbpfvA.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin, 2020</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="c146" name="c146"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1)</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Make Only the Choices that You are More Capable of Making than Anyone Else</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e97f" name="e97f">Effective executives at all levels make the few choices that their experience, wisdom and perspective make them better equipped to make than anyone else — and stop there. If you start making choices that a direct report is as well-positioned to make as you, you are destroying her effectiveness and she would be smart to leave rather than work for you. When AG Lafley took over P&amp;G in crisis in 2000, he made a few key choices: 1) focus on returning to winning in P&amp;G’s ten biggest brands, in its ten biggest countries, through its ten biggest customers; 2) refocus on the consumer as boss; and 3) start winning in-store at ‘the first moment of truth.’</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8859" name="8859"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2)</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Explain your Choices and the Reasoning Behind Them.</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5c90" name="5c90"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Simon Sinek had it right</a>, if your people don’t know the why, they won’t treat you as their leader. My experience is that you must explain your choices and the reasoning behind them so many times that you will want to throw up when you hear yourself explain it again — only then will you have done a good job.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7406" name="7406"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3)</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Explicitly Identify the Next Downstream Choice</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="52ba" name="52ba">After you have made and explained your choices, specify the choices that you want to have made by each one of your direct reports in keeping with the choices you have made. This has three components:</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="150e" name="150e"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">a)</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Specify the problem that you believe needs to be solved by their choice.</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0989" name="0989">While the problem doesn’t need to be perfectly defined, you need your subordinate to solve a problem that stands in the way of your strategy coming to fruition. When Lafley put Deb Henretta in charge of fixing the Diapers business as a key component of his turnaround strategy, he specified the problem: “We created this category and now we are trailing Kimberly-Clark’s Huggies brand. We have gotten too focused on what our engineers find stimulating and away from what motivates and excites moms. And we split our business between two brands, and I don’t know what Luvs stands for relative to Pampers.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0261" name="0261"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">b)</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Specify what a good answer would look like.</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="598f" name="598f">If the request is vague and abstract, you are likely to get either nothing because the subordinate will spin his wheels or come back something equally abstract and unhelpful. Lafley was clear: “Deb, I need a set of choices that sees us taking back category leadership from K-C by being more relevant and compelling to moms and that resolves the question of Luvs — we need it to have a productive purpose, or it should be jettisoned.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="734a" name="734a"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">c)</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Explain how their choice links back to your choice.</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="68c5" name="68c5">This both helps with motivation — the why — and helps the subordinate judge the quality of her emerging choice. “Deb: For our turnaround strategy to work, we have to be winning in our ten biggest brands. Pampers is our single biggest brand. There is no way we can achieve our goals without winning with Pampers. Even if it takes sustained investment over a period of years, we have to find a clever way to beat K-C.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2026" name="2026"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">4)</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Assist in Making the Downstream Choice</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7ac2" name="7ac2">Make a genuine offer to assist your subordinate with the choice you have given him. While you don’t have the bandwidth to make all the choices of your subordinates, you should have the bandwidth to help those who request it. My experience is that they will be careful with your time and that they will really appreciate it. But perhaps the most important feature of doing this is that it avoids the costliest problem: a subordinate getting confused and stuck, and then hiding that fact from you. You hate it when you find out a year later that the subordinate really didn’t understand what you needed, and you have to restart from scratch. Offering to assist is a technique for generating early warning on problems.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2e13" name="2e13"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">5)</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Commit to Revisit Your Choice Based on Downstream Feedback</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="363d" name="363d">Indicate your willingness to revisit your choice if your subordinate can’t find any viable choice that would be consistent with your choice. You will note on the cascade diagram at the head of the article that the vertical arrows run both ways. This is because no matter how prescient a superior is, she won’t make strategy choices at her level that are 100% actionable — i.e., for which subordinates can make consistent follow up choices. In my experience, it is much more productive to be open to modifying your choices to make cascading choices possible than to have subordinates knowing that they can’t make any set of choices that are consistent with yours but hiding that from you. If those arrows just flow down, the system isn’t self-correcting: it is self-sealing in a dangerous way.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b72d" name="b72d"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">6)</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ask for the Process to be Repeated at the Next Level</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="edff" name="edff">Explicitly ask your subordinate to repeat this process with his direct reports. If he is smart about it, he will figure that out on his own by watching and modelling your behavior. But until then, it is important to reinforce this as your expectation — and follow up in future conversations to make sure she is doing so.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="996c" name="996c"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Management System for Choice Chartering</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3c25" name="3c25">The management system to support effective choice chartering has three main components:</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="30bc" name="30bc"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1)</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Choice Initiation</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f836" name="f836">As a leader, you need to determine one-by-one what choices each direct report needs to make for your choices to be put into productive action. And then you need to create a short choice charter document that specifies the problem that you want to have solved by way of the direct report’s choice, specifies what characteristics that choice must have, and shows how that choice links back to your choice. If the choice charter is more than one page, it will be ineffective because the length means that you haven’t thought it through enough to write a short, crisp note.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6c6a" name="6c6a">You then need to take that choice charter to the meeting with each direct report and have a discussion to reach agreement on and understanding of the assignment that you are giving the direct report. It may result in modification or enhancement or clarification of the choice assignment. The agreement should specify the timing by which the direct report will deliver a choice for you to ratify.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dc9a" name="dc9a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2)</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Choice Capture</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cb28" name="cb28">There must be a system to capture the results of the discussion. That should take the form of an update to the choice charter that reflects the discussion with the direct report, including the addition of the agreed upon date by which the choice should be presented to you for ratification. These choice charters should be organized in a physical binder or digital folder so that at a glance, you can determine which choices that are necessary to fulfill your strategy goals are being worked on by each of your direct reports.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ef03" name="ef03"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3)</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Choice Monitoring</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d803" name="d803">Finally, there must be a monitoring system to ensure progress toward the choice goals. The timeline should be agreed upon in your choice chartering meetings. It is their responsibility to adhere to the schedule and your responsibility to monitor their progress.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1c7a" name="1c7a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insight</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="d4b4" name="d4b4">Regardless of where you exist in an organization’s hierarchy, you have the responsibility to both make and charter choices. It would be optimal if your superior follows the six elements of good chartering. But even if she doesn’t, you can take responsibility for making the choices your superior appears to need from you and charter great choices below you. That means adhering to the six elements of great choice chartering for each of your subordinates and creating a management system for initiating, capturing, and monitoring those choices. That is the only way I know of ensuring ‘great execution.’</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Sadly, most strategic plans do not do so. Rather, they make lists of initiatives which the company will pursue. That is why I am dedicating my 7th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights piece to From Laudable List to How to Really Win. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6c4c" name="6c4c">You’ve seen the lists: improve cost structure, increase innovation, get closer to customers, rationalize IT systems, etc. Because strategy is seen as a collection of initiatives, often these get referred to as ‘strategies.’ I.e., “We have five strategies. They are a, b, c, d, and e.” No. A company doesn’t have five strategies: it has one. A strategy is an integrated set of choices that positions a company to win.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c008" name="c008"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Laudable Lists</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2471" name="2471">Lots of people (bless them!) read Playing to Win and find the five-box strategy cascade compelling. But for many, the instinctive reaction is to simply put their list of initiatives into the How-to-Win (HTW) box and call it a Playing to Win Strategy. In general, the items on the list are truly laudable.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5de3" name="5de3">For example, for a packaged food company in a non-US market:</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4575" name="4575">· Increase convenience for the modern homemaker</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b5b8" name="b5b8">· Communicate to modern homemakers in ways that resonate with them</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8958" name="8958">· Leverage superior shelf position across all trade channels</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="62e4" name="62e4">· Leverage strong brand equity<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong>from our existing from-scratch cooking ingredients</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2817" name="2817">· Develop broad product offering<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong>at price points across socioeconomic classes</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6fbe" name="6fbe">· Develop taste profile<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong>that matches the traditional homemade taste</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e60f" name="e60f">Or, for a business equipment product producer:</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ebe9" name="ebe9">· Co-develop with customers and channels</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0161" name="0161">· Create digital and physical experiences throughout the customer journey</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f048" name="f048">· Create integrated solutions that generate customer value and loyalty</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="be3d" name="be3d">· Optimize yield management</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="114b" name="114b">· Lead in the development of new technologies</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ddc2" name="ddc2">Or, for the China market for a large multinational:</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="595d" name="595d">· Move at China speed with faster cycles</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6428" name="6428">· Create China-unique portfolio with China-specific design</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c5f7" name="c5f7">· Lead market in product innovation</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="534f" name="534f">· Reposition brand to feature Chinese values</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b867" name="b867">· Integrate channel for one face of company</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b843" name="b843">· Go digital</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d86e" name="d86e">There are a few important things to note for the practice of strategy in these descriptions of HTW. First, not even one of the seventeen combined items across these three lists can be considered a bad idea. They are all eminently laudable initiatives. Second, the vast majority of the items call for improvement for the company in question — create, optimize, leverage, reposition, integrate. This reinforces the laudability of the items: why not seek to improve? But third, there is very little about actually being better than competition — actually winning. There are hints: one ‘superior’ plus two ‘leads.’ But there are just tiny hints of winning.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9867" name="9867">Each example, food, business equipment and China market, represents an approach for the company to play better than before, but definitively not for winning. The problem with improving without intent to win is that the winner with whom the company will continue to compete will persist in treating it as a weaker competitor to bully and push around. Consequently, I find that the payoffs to initiatives to improve without an intent to win are typically disappointing. Usually, the financial improvement that is expected does not come to fruition because improving does not solve the myriad problems caused by losing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b792" name="b792"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Theory of Competitive Advantage</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9896" name="9896">Missing from the above characteristic examples of laudable-lists-masquerading-as-strategy is an explicit theory of competitive advantage. It is called How-to-Win for a reason. It is not a list of stuff that makes a company better. It is an integrated set of choices that in combination creates a way of winning — where the company has chosen to play. That means being better than, not just better. That means configuring your activities to create either greater value than your competitors for your chosen set of customers or a superior cost structure to your competitors in serving your customers.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c42a" name="c42a">There are myriad ways to generate such an advantage: having greater scale, having proprietary technology, having superior customer knowledge, having a superior brand, having superior data, etc. The chosen way must result in superior value or lower cost to serve for the chosen customer set, which is why the choice of Where-to-Play (WTP) is so important for the chosen HTW. These advantages rarely if ever apply to all customers sets — they apply to just some customers.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="482d" name="482d">The best and most long-lived advantages combine more than one superiority in their overall HTW, forcing competitors to match multiple advantages in order to attempt to catch up. Facing such an obstacle, most competitors simply choose to compete elsewhere or in different ways, as with the competitors to Southwest Airlines, Four Seasons Hotels &amp; Resorts, Vanguard Group or Thomson Reuters Westlaw.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="48c9" name="48c9">With a little bit of nudging the food company did the hard thinking to convert the laudable list above to the explicit theory of advantage below (disguised and genericized somewhat).</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="c876" name="c876"><img class="graf-image" data-height="405" data-image-id="1*3EnRhRSfoBDH-Fbk3r1lIg.png" data-width="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3EnRhRSfoBDH-Fbk3r1lIg.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="fe0a" name="fe0a">The WTP is a generation of homemakers who want to provide their family home-cooked meals but struggle to find the time to cook entirely from scratch. The theory of advantage involves combining an already trusted brand for from-scratch ingredients, with a beloved cooking show that could be leveraged far more, with proprietary understanding of the customer set due to being a broadly leading consumer branded food company, and a distribution advantage stemming from the same breadth and scale.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="480e" name="480e">That is a plausible theory of advantage not just a laudable list. But it isn’t a strategy yet. That is why there are five boxes in the strategy cascade, not just three.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="506f" name="506f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Reality Check</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2c0d" name="2c0d">I call the last two boxes of the strategy cascade the reality check.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="56a3" name="56a3"><img class="graf-image" data-height="405" data-image-id="1*AF965jx3wnDSErwztes-TQ.png" data-width="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AF965jx3wnDSErwztes-TQ.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="e1c5" name="e1c5">The first three boxes, at best, provide a plausible theory of advantage in a given place that meets the winning aspiration. It will only become a reality to the extent that the company is in possession of a distinctive set of capabilities which enables it to achieve the advantage theorized to an extent no competitor can match. If a competitor has the same capabilities, it can match your strategy as soon as it figures out what you are doing with your identical capabilities.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5dc3" name="5dc3">For the food company this means assessing whether, for this segment, the strength of its brand is a capability that provides superiority to the brands competitors could deploy. It means assessing the true strength and applicability of its cooking show to leverage its offerings in this segment. It means demonstrating that its customer understanding capability is really superior and quantifying the true relative benefit of its distribution capability. If these assessments hold up, then the food company has a viable strategy for winning in this space.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1e6b" name="1e6b">Furthermore as I argued in my first <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/the-role-of-management-systems-in-strategy-571583546fbe" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/the-role-of-management-systems-in-strategy-571583546fbe" target="_blank">PTW/PI</a>, if the company wants to maintain its strategy advantage over time, it needs to develop Management Systems that build and maintain the required Capabilities over time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5b6d" name="5b6d"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insight</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="7b2c" name="7b2c">When you see your strategy development effort producing a list of laudable initiatives, keep pushing the thinking until you have a plausible theory of competitive advantage. Your goal should be loftier than just improving. The goal should be to be become better than anybody else: that is, to win — in your chosen space. And when you get to the point of a plausible theory of winning, do a thorough reality check on your Capabilities and Management Systems so that you can move forward with confidence that your strategy is real and actionable, not just a hope, because hope is not a strategy!</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

The inspiration came from my friend and Drucker aficionado, Brendan Calder — thanks much. He encouraged me to write on Strategy as a Practice. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8592" name="8592">In 1954, Drucker wrote one of the most important and influential books on management in history, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Practice of Management</em>. After 66 years, it is ranked #84,351 in Books by Amazon (as of 11/22/20). For an ancient non-fiction book on the topic of management, that is a truly impressive ranking. By comparison, the median rank of the nine management books published in 2019 by authors ranking on the 2019 Thinkers50 list is #126,856. After one year, they already trail Drucker’s 66-year-old book by a substantial margin!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4b05" name="4b05"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Practice of Management </em>is well worth the re-read. It brought the world Management by Objectives (MBO) among many other useful tools and insights. But if you re-read it, you will find more about the practices in which managers need to engage than about why Drucker thought management is a practice.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="01ce" name="01ce">For that, you need to go to an interview of Drucker found in this <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/90303" href="https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/90303" rel="noopener" target="_blank">journal article</a>:</p><p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p" id="faa0" name="faa0"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Management is definitely not a “science”, as the word “science” is used in the English-speaking countries. It is equally not an “art”. It is a Practice. In that, it is similar to medicine, which it resembles in a good many other respects as well — for instance, in the need in many situations for a careful diagnosis, rather than a standard prescription. And, as in medicine, the results are not “scientific”. A successful doctor is one who cures his patients. A successful executive or manager is one whose enterprise prospers. In medicine you have a good number of foundation disciplines which are the “medical sciences”: chemistry, physiology, anatomy, and so on. But the end result is not knowledge as it is in a “science”. It is a cured patient. Management, similarly, has a substantial number of foundation disciplines. A successful manager must know a fair amount of psychology, for instance; a fair amount of economics; a fair amount of statistics — which, by the way is the one area where most executives today are most deficient. But at the same time, these are foundations rather than the practice itself.”</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dbbe" name="dbbe">I agree. And as a key aspect of management, strategy is naturally part of that practice of management. This continues to be the case despite decades-long efforts to make strategy a science. I lived that experience. Monitor Company, the firm I helped build, was a strategy consultancy built on the original intellectual property contained in Michael Porter’s 1980 classic <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Competitive Strategy. </em>The scientific framework that generated the most client attention and enthusiasm was the ‘Five Forces’ model and we spent a disproportionate amount of time in the early days calculating the structural attractiveness of our clients’ businesses using the Five Forces model. However, when the excitement of the shiny new model wore off, clients started to ask us: “OK, you assessed our industry’s structural attractiveness as medium-high, what do we do now that we know that?”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="459a" name="459a">The truthful answer was: “The hell if we know!” But it spurred us to build a practice of strategy. Much as we might have wished that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Competitive Strategy </em>had made strategy a science with a proprietary tool to apply that science, it wasn’t. Each client situation (like each patient above) had a unique circumstance with a unique set of challenges and possibilities. We had absolutely no choice but to become experienced practitioners of strategy, not strategy scientists.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c4c4" name="c4c4">That having been said, the strategy discipline has continued down a highly scientific path. Strategy courses teach students to calculate the Cournot-Nash Equilibrium to determine what to do. Or to figure out the valuable, rare, imperfectly inimitable, and non-substitutable assets (or maybe the ’N’ for non-substitutable should be ‘O’ for organization so that the scientific model is VRIO not VRIN) and, on that basis, make scientifically driven decisions. And regardless of which model you use; you absolutely must make your decisions based on intense data analytics. It is a seductive thought to be so scientifically deterministic, but sadly that is not the way the world works. Once you have performed your VRIN/VRIO analysis and your data analytics, there is still a judgment call on what to actually do. And how might you do that?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e0dd" name="e0dd">One alternative stream of thought that has emerged — I think in response to this excessively scientific vector — is that strategy is an art. This is manifested in the world of design thinking at its extreme. Strategy is an entirely creative act. Understand the user. Brainstorm ‘out-of-the-box’ solutions. And prototype them along a pathway to victory. That is, of course, a caricature. I am a proponent of design thinking, but I see lots of design thinking straying into the territory of strategy-as-art in violation of Drucker’s principles.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="483e" name="483e"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practice, Practice, Practice</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a593" name="a593">The implication of strategy as a practice is that you must get lots of practice. I have never met a great unpracticed strategist. All the great strategists I know have practiced and practiced to get there. People think of star former P&amp;G CEO AG Lafley as a ‘natural strategist.’ I don’t. I have worked with him and interviewed him about his career (for both <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Opposable Mind </em>and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Playing to Win</em>) enough to know that he was practicing strategy as far back as when he was a very young Navy officer running the retail operation of a naval base in Japan. By the time he had become a CEO and became famous as a strategist, he had three decades of intense strategy practice behind him.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0795" name="0795">For his practice of strategy, he had a great context. Many people think of General Electric as America’s CEO factory — at least historically. Indeed, it has produced lots of CEOs. However, P&amp;G is <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/money/business/2017/05/17/procter-gamble-leaders/101565838/" href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/money/business/2017/05/17/procter-gamble-leaders/101565838/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one heck of a CEO factory</a> as well — maybe even better. Why? I think that the structure of its business, with so many brands requiring independent strategies, requires its managers to get in more strategy practice reps than managers in companies in which the strategies are set more centrally. Even though Pantene and Head &amp; Shoulders are part of Shampoos &amp; Conditioners, which is part of Hair Care, which is part of Beauty Care, which is part of P&amp;G, the Global Franchise Leaders of Pantene and of Head &amp; Shoulders each have to make really important strategic decisions. That consistent practice, throughout the many layers of P&amp;G, creates future CEOs.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="85cf" name="85cf"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Strategy as a Reflective Practice</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a82d" name="a82d">But not all practice is created equal. You can go to a driving range, hit 1,000 golf balls, and not get any better. In fact, you can get worse if you practice grooving a flaw in your swing. The key is reflecting on your practice as you practice. I believe that the best thinking on this question can be drawn from Donald Schön in his 1984 book <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think in Action</em>. While he doesn’t address strategy in particular, his advice for professionals is perfectly aimed at the strategist.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8bad" name="8bad">Consistent with Drucker, he contrasts the theory of “technical rationality,” in which management can be reduced to a science with if-then relationships that hold in every case, to the reflection-in-action approach of a practitioner. The technical rationalist needs a pre-determined problem to which to apply a scientific reasoning solution. Unfortunately for them <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“In real-world practice, problems do not present themselves to the practitioner as givens. They must be constructed from the materials of problematic situations which are puzzling, troubling, and uncertain. In order to convert a problematic situation to a problem, a practitioner must do a certain kind of work. He must make sense of an uncertain situation that initially makes no sense.”</em> (p. 40)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0d49" name="0d49">The reflective practitioner continuously frames and reframes the problem based on the intended and unintended effects of actions: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“In a practitioner’s reflective conversation with a situation that he treats as unique and uncertain, he functions as an agent/experient. Through his transaction with the situation, he shapes it and makes himself a part of it” </em>(p. 163). For Schön, the reflective practitioner builds a repertoire of expectations, images, techniques, examples, understandings, actions, metaphors in order to interpret, interact with and shape the unique situations encountered and, in utilizing those metaphors, make better decisions.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5d62" name="5d62">That captures the essence of the strategist. She practices reflectively to build a repertoire that enables her to interpret each unique situation in a way that enables her to guide towards choices that are better rather than worse, in a way that uses reflection to correct the errors from unintended consequences of actions and to build on the intended consequences.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a877" name="a877">For him, the contrast between the normal view of the professional and the stance of a reflective practitioner is stark.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="4ccb" name="4ccb"><img class="graf-image" data-height="405" data-image-id="1*1NZ8FNnUkql6pvCG_RnXbw.png" data-width="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1NZ8FNnUkql6pvCG_RnXbw.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Donald Schon. The Reflective Practitioner (Basic Books 1984)</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="5ab3" name="5ab3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insight</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2df1" name="2df1">If you want to be a great strategist, don’t aspire to be a great scientist or artist. Strive to be a practitioner, per Drucker, and a reflective one, per Schön. Accomplish that goal through practice, practice, and more practice — and reflecting on every single iteration. Capture the reasoning behind what you intend to do before you do it so that you can make a comparison between what you hoped and what you achieve. If you don’t capture your logic before you act, you will ex-post-rationalize yourself as having succeeded brilliantly — and thereby doom yourself to not learning a thing. Build your repertoire of expectations, images, techniques, examples, understandings, actions, and metaphors. That is what will make you a great strategist.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="f0d6" name="f0d6">How do you get that strategy practice — isn’t it only done once a year by the most senior of management? That is a fallacy for you to reject. Everybody throughout the organization makes strategy decisions — to do some things and not others. It is more obvious at some corporations, like P&amp;G, as mentioned above. But you make Where-to-Play and How-to-Win decisions regardless of where you sit in the organizational hierarchy. Practice on making every decision that your supervisor gives you. If you think about it, the decision will require choices to do some things and not others. Think about it in terms of WTP and HTW and it will provide you the strategy practice you need to work toward becoming a great strategy practitioner.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

When and how often should you do strategy? How long should strategy last? So, I thought it would make sense to do my 9th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights piece on Strategy and Time. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f66f" name="f66f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">When NOT TO DO Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fe2e" name="fe2e">The generally accepted view is that strategic planning should be on an annual cycle. Hence, the dominant practice is to perform a strategy exercise as the front-end to the annual budgeting process. I understand the sentiment and the practice. It is true that a company cannot budget intelligently without a strategy. Strategy should drive investment of both expense and capital dollars, which should both be aimed at achieving the target value equation for the targeted set of customers.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="da3a" name="da3a">But there are two logical weaknesses in this budget-driven argument for strategy timing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f028" name="f028">First, you don’t actually have to run some form of a strategy exercise to prepare for the budget. As I have argued earlier in this series, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/an-idea/strategy-is-what-you-do-not-what-you-say-a6e483840557" href="https://medium.com/an-idea/strategy-is-what-you-do-not-what-you-say-a6e483840557" target="_blank">strategy is what you do, not what you say</a>. This means that every company has a strategy, regardless of whether it ever ran an exercise that we would describe as strategic planning. Revealed by its actions, every company sells to some customers and not others, has a way of competing for those customers, has invested in a certain set of capabilities, and has in place a certain group of management systems. All it needs to do is reverse-engineer its current strategy-in-use to have the starting point for its budgeting process. It doesn’t have to engage in a new strategic planning exercise as a prerequisite to budgeting.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bd51" name="bd51">Second, in organizing strategy to feed the budgeting process, recognize that the importance of budgeting — revenue budgeting in particular — is overrated. Every year, countless millions of person-hours a year are spent revenue budgeting. This is because we tend to believe that revenue budgeting is important because if you budget for revenue, it is more likely to show up. It is only more likely to show up in destructive ways. Customers decide what revenues to send to the company and whether they do so or not is a function of the quality of the company’s strategy. Strategy is the only thing that compels customers to send their sales dollars. If the strategy doesn’t produce a positive value equation for a given set of customers, those customers won’t send the company their sales dollars — and they certainly couldn’t care less whether they were assumed in your revenue budget.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0d0d" name="0d0d">However, there is another way to get customers to send money when they aren’t inclined to send as much as the budget calls for. It is to sacrifice the future for the present. For example, the company can run a sale/price promotion that damages the brand and trains customers to wait for the next sale before buying again. Or, if the company sells through a distribution channel, the company can stuff the distribution channel by convincing it to load up on its inventory in excess of its needs before the end of the budget period. That gets current revenue up helping to achieve this year’s revenue budget but hurts the relationship with the distribution channel and makes it harder still to achieve next year’s revenue budget, requiring still more desperate revenue-seeking measures.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4032" name="4032">The best thing for a company to do is to invest as its strategy dictates, specify the amount of revenue that would result if the strategy is to be successful — and then manage accordingly and watch. That would save millions of person hours a year currently wasted in revenue forecasting/budgeting and reduce the damage to future health of companies.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="05a1" name="05a1">Because of these two considerations, I view that doing a new strategy every year as the front-end to budgeting is of limited utility. Is it a terrible thing? No. It is just of limited utility</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="00c7" name="00c7"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">When TO DO Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0b24" name="0b24">Much more productive is to adhere to the principle that when a feature ceases to be true that has to be true for your strategy to work as intended, is the time to rethink strategy — without hesitation. Recall from my previous post in this series, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/strategy-as-problem-solving-5c6fb9291d87" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/strategy-as-problem-solving-5c6fb9291d87" target="_blank">strategy is a problem-solving tool</a>. The archetypal problem in strategy is to have an aspiration for your strategy that requires a set of features to be true, but one or more of those features is no longer true. That will guarantee the emergence of a gap between your aspirations and the outcomes you achieve — soon if not already. That is precisely the time to get to work, not at the time of the next planning cycle.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="971a" name="971a">It is for this reason that I advocate developing strategy by addressing the most important question in strategy: what would have to be true (WWHTBT)? A team working on strategy should develop a range of possibilities that if successful would make the gap between aspirations and outcomes go away and then reverse-engineer each possibility to determine the WWHTBT for each to be the best strategy to pursue. This is the template I use to reverse-engineer a strategy possibility.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="2485" name="2485"><img class="graf-image" data-height="405" data-image-id="1*zFDGGl4YLWmIcU1DF4T45w.png" data-width="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zFDGGl4YLWmIcU1DF4T45w.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="a53e" name="a53e">Eventually you choose as your strategy the possibility that can best eliminate the gap between your aspiration and the outcomes you are currently achieving and for which the WWHTBT is either true now or you are confident can be made true.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dcd6" name="dcd6">The bonus of doing this WWHTBT work is that you then have the WWHTBT for the chosen strategy. Every morning, you should arrive at your desk, pull out the WWHTBT for your strategy and ask: Is our WWHTBT still true? If it is true, then you can comfortably get back to whatever is on your agenda for the day. If not, then you should start retooling your strategy that very instant. It doesn’t matter what time of year it is. It doesn’t matter how far away budget development is. Nothing else in the business matters as much. The canary in the coal mine just keeled over. The problems may not have shown up yet in the financials. But they will if WWHTBT is no longer true. That is when to do strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5536" name="5536"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How Long a Strategy Should Last</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="46bc" name="46bc">In addition to ‘when,’ people ask me ‘how long?’ What should be the time horizon of a strategy? They tend to want a very specific answer. Budgets are typically for one year. Should strategies be for three years or five years or what? The answer is: it depends. Of course, the longer a successful winning strategy continues its winning ways, the more valuable it will be, though even great strategies need to be tweaked periodically to keep winning. But how long does a strategy have to be a winning one for it to be a successful strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9d08" name="9d08">That depends on the time frame for which your capital investments must be in place to earn a total life cycle return that is above the relevant cost of capital. Some businesses require little or no capital investment because their cost structure is predominantly expenses. In the modern business world, this is the case for many online businesses that bootstrap themselves and use SAAS providers, leased space, etc. to minimize investment capital. At the other end of the spectrum a business such as mining has to make huge long term capital investments to develop a greenfield mine.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0350" name="0350">For the online startup, the advantage doesn’t have to last very long — perhaps only several of years — for it to earn a return on its investment that is above the cost of capital. For the mining company, the competitive advantage that its new mine seeks to provide it will probably have to last more than 25 years, perhaps even 50 years, for its strategy to have been considered successful. This, by the way, might make it seem as though the online business is much more favorable because the advantages don’t need to be as long-lived. Not so. It is a pick-your-poison situation. When little investment is required, there are endless entrants who are willing to throw some spaghetti against the wall in hopes that, for instance, their spaghetti — in the case of online gaming — will be the next Angry Birds or Candy Crush or Fortnite. That is one reason why strategies in that domain come and go more quickly. In developing greenfield mines, the investment magnitude and the patience required are daunting. But that means that most will be daunted and not try. But those who do try know that their advantage must be maintained for a generation. That is why new greenfield mines tend to only to be built if they can achieve a cost position at the bottom of the cost curve so as to have a robust position across 25–50 years of market fluctuations and competitive activity.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4860" name="4860"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2492" name="2492">The dominance of the current model of annual strategic plans means that you will probably be in a situation that requires you to participate in an annual strategic planning exercise at a predetermined time of year. That timing is a bad idea and to the extent you have control, don’t do it. Especially in diversified companies, strategy development should be going on in various parts of the company on a continuous basis because the various businesses will experience problems at their own unique times.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="83ea" name="83ea">Even if you forced to participate in the annual ritual, you should spend a minute every morning to pull out your WWHTBT and ask yourself to what extent it still holds true. If it doesn’t, start reviewing and revising your strategy then and there — regardless of what any schedule says. You will have the best chance of rejuvenating your strategy before its warts become evident. Remember, your WWHTBT is your canary in the coal mine.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8cc9" name="8cc9">And when you are developing your strategy, assess it on the basis of whether it delivers a competitive advantage that has a sufficiently high probability of lasting long enough to justify the investment of the capital that is required to carry it out. That required length will depend on the kind of investments you will need to make in your specific business.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="3831" name="3831">If you follow these ‘when’ and ‘how long’ principles, you will have created harmony between strategy and time!</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

So, I decided to tackle in my 10th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece, Playing to Win for Social Sector Organizations (SSO). (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4c92" name="4c92">The short answer is that it does. In fact, I use it religiously in that world, for example in the turnaround of the Rotman School, and for the SSO boards on which I have served, including the Skoll Foundation, the Hospital for Sick Children (Sick Kids), and Tennis Canada. You can find a description of the successful Tennis Canada strategy <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/strategic-transformation-at-tennis-canada/" href="https://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/strategic-transformation-at-tennis-canada/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9de2" name="9de2">As I always say, the heart of the strategy is a matched Where-to-Play/How-to-Win (WTP/HTW) choice. This applies equally for SSOs but there are important nuances for both HTW and WTP in the SSO context.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="77c1" name="77c1"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">HTW Nuances for Social Sector Organizations</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5d92" name="5d92">I start with HTW because that is the area in which people express the most concern about the PTW framework. Isn’t winning inappropriate? Sick Kids shouldn’t be trying to beat other pediatric hospitals. Skoll Foundation shouldn’t be trying to beat other charitable foundations. That is correct. That is why for SSOs, we need to refine the concept of HTW.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3f96" name="3f96">The fundamental structure of most SSOs is that of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sided_market" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sided_market" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a two-sided market</a>. Google provides a good example of a two-sided market. The Google searcher receives the benefit of the service but doesn’t pay anything (well, except surrendering all privacy). Payment is made by an advertiser for the service of providing access to the searcher. In the classic form of a two-sided market, there is the subsidy side (in this case the searchers) and the money side (the advertisers) and a firm in the middle (Google) serving the two sides of the market. Another example is credit cards where the subsidy side is the credit card holder, and the money side is the merchant.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5402" name="5402">Most SSOs are structured (implicitly) as two-sided markets. The recipients of the service are different (entirely or in part) than the funders of the service. The Skoll Foundation grantees provide good examples. The One Acre Fund provides smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa with tools, training, and financing so that farmers can enhance the productivity of their small farms enough to escape poverty. The recipients of the service (the subsidy side) are the farmers, while the funders of the operation (the money side) are charitable foundations, including the Skoll Foundation. The same kind of structure holds for the Educate Girls Foundation, which works on reforming the Indian school system to provide equal educational opportunities for girls. Indian girls (and in due course the Indian economy) are the beneficiaries and charitable foundations are the funders. For Sick Kids, the child and family benefit, and the government plus philanthropists pay.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6091" name="6091">What is the mechanism of the HTW? Let’s use the Google example for the for-profit world. Google does enough for the searchers on the subsidy side that they engage in an activity that is of value to the advertisers on the money side. Google achieves a competitive advantage by providing value to the money side that is in excess of the cost of providing service to the subsidy side by a greater margin than for any direct competitors for the money side’s spending. As in the case of strategy generally, that can accrue by way of providing more value than competitors to the money side at the same cost to serve the subsidy side, or by providing equal value to the money side at a lower cost to serve the subsidy side.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cd8b" name="cd8b">What does it mean to win in an SSO? It means doing something for the subsidy side that is of value far in excess of the cost paid by the money side. One Acre Fund creates value for Sub Saharan smallholder farmers that is far in excess of the funds provided by the Skoll Foundation and others. If you do that, those funders will choose to fund One Acre over doing something else with their resources. And they will be inclined to give One Acre more funding so that it can create more value. That is winning. Just as in for-profits, it requires a clever way to create value: a business model that provides lots of value for more modest costs. Former Skoll Foundation CEO Sally Osberg and I <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Beyond-Better-Social-Entrepreneurship/dp/1633690687/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1441791027&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=getting+beyond+better" href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Beyond-Better-Social-Entrepreneurship/dp/1633690687/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1441791027&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=getting+beyond+better" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote a book</a> about how that is done in the social entrepreneurship space.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ba3b" name="ba3b">For SSOs, the HTW isn’t focused on beating competitors. It is focused on the creation of value for the targeted recipients that is both appreciated by funders and far in excess of costs in its magnitude. An SSO will know that it is winning if its funders are keen to give it more resources so that it can provide more such value to more such recipients.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f255" name="f255"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">WTP Nuances for Social Sector Organizations</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="87e8" name="87e8">WTP choices are very important for SSOs, just as with for profit organization, because WTP and HTW must be a carefully matched pair. No HTW is great for every WTP and no WTP is perfect for every HTW.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d242" name="d242">A challenge for every for-profit organization is scope creep — doing more things because you can, not because it strengthens your HTW. In my experience, scope creep is even more endemic and problematic in SSOs. Generally speaking, SSOs are staffed with good hearted people who genuinely want to help the target audience. So, when they see an opportunity either to help the target audience in more ways or to help a wider group, they tend to let their WTP broaden.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="698c" name="698c">I remember vividly a Skoll Foundation board discussion on this front. Our WTP/HTW was to fund social entrepreneurs who were tackling an unpleasant equilibrium and had figured out a clever way to transform that equilibrium into a more positive one — like One Acre. Better techniques helped smallholders increase yields to move from precarious poverty to stable self-sufficiency — a decidedly better equilibrium. In one of my last board meetings, a grant proposal came up that in no way even attempted to transform an equilibrium. When I challenged whether it fit in our WTP, a particularly outspoken board member declared as the rationale: they save lives! So, by the way, do emergency room nurses and doctors, ambulance drivers, lifeguards, suicide counselors, etc. Such a massively broadened WTP would ensure no distinctive HTW — but the argument carried the day.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="42c1" name="42c1">That is scope creep in action — doing things because you can, not because your strategy says you should. But why not ‘save lives?’ Well, if having a WTP that is ‘saving lives’ doesn’t result in spending the funder’s resources in a way that produces huge leverage, you won’t get more funding, you will get less — and then be able to help the world in fewer ways.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f7fc" name="f7fc">A key to success at Sick Kids was figuring out where we could uniquely add value and where we should partner with organizations that could add value better than us — if we provided a small but important ingredient. The latter turned out to be the case in pediatric rehabilitation services. It took a concerted effort to rein in scope creep. But we did it and both Sick Kids and our rehab partner had a superior WTP/HTW’s as a result.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5d18" name="5d18"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Winning Aspiration, Capabilities &amp; Management Systems</strong></p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="b05f" name="b05f"><img class="graf-image" data-height="405" data-image-id="1*sNWM4_cD5dsiwjhdypbAcA.png" data-width="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sNWM4_cD5dsiwjhdypbAcA.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="e360" name="e360">As with for-profit organizations, SSOs need to ensure that they flesh out the entire choice cascade. The WTP/HTW needs to be paired with a Winning Aspiration that is motivational to the key stakeholders — the recipients, the funders and the SSO itself. It also needs to have the reality check from Capabilities and Management Systems. Only if the WTP/HTW can be translated into a distinctive set of Capabilities that the SSO is able to build and Management Systems that maintain those distinctive Capabilities over time will the PTW strategy be real, not just a binder for display on a shelf.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="202c" name="202c"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ade5" name="ade5">If you are a manager or a board member for an SSO, you can productively use PTW for developing your strategy. When thinking about HTW, think of the SSO as operating in a two-sided market in which your task is to deliver value far in excess of costs to a recipient base that motivates capital providers to fund your work. Cleverness and creativity are required to come up with an operating model that provides that gap between value and cost.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="35ef" name="35ef">Make sure your WTP enhances the power of the HTW as a great matched pair. And watch for the ever-present danger of scope creep. Your sustainability as an SSO is based on your ability to create value that is unambiguously greater than cost and if you broaden your WTP into areas that weaken your HTW, it will jeopardize your sustainability. If broadening your WTP can actually strengthen your HTW, then do it, but only under that condition.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="edd2" name="edd2">And don’t forget the Capabilities and Management Systems. They need to play their role in ensuring that you win where you have chosen to play — and that will enable you to achieve your Winning Aspiration.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

So, I thought I would tackle the influence of design on my approach to strategy in my 11th Playing to Win/Practitioners Insights (PTW/PI) piece: Strategy &amp; Design Thinking. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4bfa" name="4bfa"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Bit of History</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9e69" name="9e69">I frame it as the influence of design on strategy because I started thinking about strategy over a decade before I got interested in design in business. I started practicing full-time as a strategist in 1981 and got more deeply ensconced in the theory of strategy during the 1987 to 1996 period when I took primary responsibility at Monitor Company for developing the second-generation strategy process for the firm.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ba60" name="ba60">On that journey, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2010/05/the-day-i-discovered-the-most.html" href="https://hbr.org/2010/05/the-day-i-discovered-the-most.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my eureka moment with strategy</a> came in 1994 during an offsite strategy workshop with Inmet Mining when I discovered that the most important question in strategy is not <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what is true</em>, but rather <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what would have to be true (WWHTBT)</em>. Based in this insight, I built a new process for strategy, which I called Strategic Choice Structuring, during the 1995–1996 period working with forest products company Avenor, the HVAC business of Honeywell, and the North American business of P&amp;G. The resultant strategy process is illustrated by the following slide from that era.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="9d5f" name="9d5f"><img class="graf-image" data-height="540" data-image-id="1*oIbe89jIO2p6G26WOXGTAA.png" data-width="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oIbe89jIO2p6G26WOXGTAA.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="d1ef" name="d1ef">Towards the end of that period, I became interested in the role of design in business strategy, largely by accident. In 1993, an organizational consultant friend asked me to get involved in a project to help Herman Miller create a new strategy. Herman Miller is legendary for its design-led approach to office furniture, powered by relationships with a number of the past century’s most famous industrial designers, including Gilbert Rhode, Charles Nelson, Charles Eames, and most recently Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf, the duo who designed the legendary Aeron chair which happened to have its spectacularly successful release during the period of my work with the company on strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="233f" name="233f">The assignment was unique because it was the first time I was hired by the head of design, a wonderful man named Rob Harvey, rather than either a line executive or the head of strategy. Rob and I butted heads until I started listening more intently to what I only later recognized as his critique of my approach as utter un-designerly. He pushed me to co-create more with the leadership team rather than drive the process myself and enforced a less linear and far more iterative process than I would have used in the previous 15 years of strategy consulting.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="972f" name="972f">Shortly after I ended my work at Herman Miller, I started working with Tina Brown on a turnaround strategy for The New Yorker magazine and recognized that even though her title was Editor-in-Chief and her medium was a weekly magazine rather than a product like office furniture, her way of thinking and working bore an uncanny resemblance to what I had watched with Rob Harvey.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="50c0" name="50c0">The things that I had been learning about the linkage of design with strategy just percolated in my head for a few years from mid-1998 when I ended my work with The New Yorker to October 2002 when I met Tim Brown and David Kelley of IDEO at the behest of CEO AG Lafley, my client at P&amp;G, and Claudia Kotchka, his newly appointed VP of Design Innovation &amp; Strategy. That kicked off six years of intensive collaboration with Tim and Claudia at P&amp;G, including working on an integration of the strategy and design processes at P&amp;G that we called DesignWorks, which was piloted in the hair care category in 2005 and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co8BAz5LOOk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co8BAz5LOOk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rolled out across P&amp;G</a> thereafter.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d280" name="d280">But it also precipitated a conceptual conversation with Tim about the essence of design thinking, in particular during an <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.ideo.com/post/capitalism-needs-design-thinking" href="https://www.ideo.com/post/capitalism-needs-design-thinking" rel="noopener" target="_blank">August 2003 meeting</a> between us on the future direction of IDEO, which was pivoting away from pure product design to customer experience design, organizational design and even design of strategies. I think that Tim, who was much more learned on design than me, recognized that we were attempting to flesh out the meaning of the concept of design thinking, which Richard Buchanan had introduced in his legendary 1992 article, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="http://web.mit.edu/jrankin/www/engin_as_lib_art/Design_thinking.pdf" href="http://web.mit.edu/jrankin/www/engin_as_lib_art/Design_thinking.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wicked Problems in Design Thinking</a>, an article I read several years later.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="36f4" name="36f4">We both ended up writing 2009 books on design thinking, mine <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OC07J4/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i4" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OC07J4/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i4" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Design of Business</em></a>, his <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Change-Design-Revised-Updated-Organizations/dp/0062856626/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2OF5EW9QQEDQH&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=tim+brown+change+by+design&amp;qid=1607844437&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=Tim+Brown+Change%2Cstripbooks%2C324&amp;sr=1-1" href="https://www.amazon.com/Change-Design-Revised-Updated-Organizations/dp/0062856626/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2OF5EW9QQEDQH&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=tim+brown+change+by+design&amp;qid=1607844437&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=Tim+Brown+Change%2Cstripbooks%2C324&amp;sr=1-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Change by Design</em></a>. I was pleased to find out a few months ago that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jpim.12466" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jpim.12466" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a recent article in the Journal of Product Innovation Management</a> determined that these two books rank among the top five (#2 and #3 respectively) most cited publications in design thinking (alongside the above-mentioned Buchanan article).</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="782c" name="782c"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Designerly Enhancements</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="19a5" name="19a5">My involvement in and learnings from design caused me to make two significant designerly enhancements to the mid-1990s strategy process resulting in the process shown at the head of the article, one early in the process, the other at the back end.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4aad" name="4aad">The first designerly enhancement was to shift from framing a choice to framing a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">how might we question </em>(HMWQ) as the step after issues/problem identification. In my original process, I asked the team working on strategy to frame the kind of choice they would need to make to cause the identified problem to go away. The purpose was to get the group into a choice-making mode and help them understand the seriousness and consequence of the decision. However, over time I found that this exercise tended to confuse teams more than help them. It was hard for teams to figure out what would be an indicative choice that would make the problem go away. In addition, it sometimes anchored teams on the choices from that early framing as the only possibilities, when I hoped it would be a productive start to generating many possibilities. When I was exposed to the long tradition of the HMWQ in design, I found that it is a better way to start a team on solving the identified problem. It is an aspirational question and one that leads nicely into the generation of a broad, diverse, and optimistic set of possibilities.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0787" name="0787">I have also adopted into my strategy process the practice of performing an exploratory round of qualitative customer research in preparation for generating the HMWQ. Previously, I had waited until the testing phase to work with the team to perform more declarative (and typically quantitative) customer research on the possibilities that had been generated. But I found that diving into a bit of research up front helped refine the problem that needed solving and develop the motivating HMWQ.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1d8c" name="1d8c">The second and bigger enhancement was converting the Design Valid Tests and Conduct Analysis steps into Testing &amp; Transformation. In the pre-designerly process, the standard that I enforced was that if a possibility didn’t pass the test of each barrier condition, it was eliminated. But I came to realize through my greater appreciation of design approaches that the process of rapid, iterative prototyping was in fact a process for making something true that didn’t start out that way.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="036b" name="036b">And I also realized, in part through my work with Tony Golsby-Smith on <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/management-is-much-more-than-a-science" href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/management-is-much-more-than-a-science" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the implications of Aristotle for strategy</a>, that we can operate with two very different goals in mind. The first is to attempt to hone and refine the current effect that we are producing. The second is to strive to be the cause of a new and better effect. In the former, it is fine to have a standard that requires tests to show that each condition currently holds true because we aren’t attempting to create something new. In the latter, a core requirement of fundamental change is to make something true that is currently not true. And when we think about great strategies, they have that creative quality.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e312" name="e312">Thus, my rule is now that we shouldn’t automatically choose the strategy possibility for which all elements of the WWHTBT currently hold true. Instead, a superior possibility may be one for which one or more key elements are currently not true, but we develop a transformation plan that is both plausible and compelling for making them true.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="141d" name="141d"><img class="graf-image" data-height="405" data-image-id="1*1IX-N08T6cpCyNFBz-SyHQ.png" data-width="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1IX-N08T6cpCyNFBz-SyHQ.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="ba9c" name="ba9c">A motivating HMWQ at the front end and a compelling transformation plan at the back end are the two major contributions to the strategy process from the domain of design thinking.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bcd3" name="bcd3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="4b81" name="4b81">Strategy and design thinking shouldn’t be thought of as separate and distinct conceptual or practical domains. Rather, there are just more and less designerly ways of doing strategy. Like strategy, design is a problem-solving technique; so, start with a problem. Then encourage an aspirational exploration of a variety of possibilities by setting a bold HMWQ. When you reverse-engineer each possibility to determine WWHTBT, don’t think of the barriers to choice — i.e., the things that would have to be true but currently aren’t — as your enemies. They might provide the ability to create a huge strategic success by making something true for customers that is currently not true. For that to happen, you will need to develop a creative and plausible transformation plan. That is a designerly approach to strategy and one that I believe is consistent with the development of great strategies.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

(Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="303e" name="303e"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Bit of History</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ef5e" name="ef5e">I kicked off my work on Integrative Thinking in 1991 when I became curious about why giant global companies would hire an upstart firm like Monitor Company, led by 30-somethings (I was 35 at the time), to solve their most difficult problems when there were plenty of much larger firms staffed by much more senior people. I came to the conclusion that they hired us when they had a problem that slopped across traditional categorical boundaries. That is, it wasn’t a sales force effectiveness problem or a marketing problem or a relative cost position problem. Both the problem and the symptoms that it generated were unique, apparently multi-faceted and vexing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c54f" name="c54f">That led me to further explore what we did (at our best) that made Monitor worthy of their trust in tackling such critical problems. The answer was that we thought differently. Our instinct was not to attempt to quickly categorize the problem, go to the case database, look for the most similar previous case, and apply that template to the client’s problem.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cadb" name="cadb">That hypothesis — a different way of thinking — was a start, but it was far too abstract to satisfy me. So, I set out on what turned out to be a long journey to figure out what that way of thinking entailed. My approach was to attempt to reverse engineer the thinking patterns of highly successful leaders. That took another decade or so and culminated in me writing The Opposable Mind in 2007, from which the quote above is drawn. The central thing that those Monitor clients sought, and highly successful leaders naturally did, was to find creative resolutions of tensions and those solutions arose out of thinking across established models and categories, not within them. I spent the next decade working with colleagues on a practical methodology for finding such creative resolutions and wrote a follow up book with Jennifer Riel, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Great-Choices-Integrative-Thinking/dp/1633692965/" href="https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Great-Choices-Integrative-Thinking/dp/1633692965/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Creating Great Choices</a> in 2017.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6898" name="6898"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Contradiction?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ed0f" name="ed0f">I think that students long to find gotcha-type contradictions in the thinking of their professors, so I routinely get the question: how can you be for making choices that embrace tradeoffs in your work on strategy but in integrative thinking you advocate refusing to accept tradeoffs? The answer is that I don’t want leaders to accept a fundamentally unpleasant tradeoffs but rather only accept tradeoffs that allow them to accomplish their strategic goals. Southwest Airlines co-founder Herb Kelleher was perfectly happy to accept the tradeoff that offering only economy seating with no pre-assigned seats would alienate all business and first-class fliers. But he didn’t care. He wanted to serve passengers who saw his airline as a substitute for taking a bus. Thus, he didn’t need to find a creative resolution of the tension between offering coach class only versus multiple classes. He happily chose and that strategy choice made Southwest monumentally successful.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="52e8" name="52e8">In contrast, Four Seasons Hotels &amp; Resorts founder Isadore Sharp found the tradeoff between the comfort of a small motel and the amenities of a large hotel to be too painful to accept. So, he thought hard and created a Four Seasons model that incorporated both comfort and amenities in a classic Integrative Thinking move. But he still made numerous either/or choices in that new model — just choices that he was happy to make. For example, he was happy to get out of hotel development and ownership, and just participate in hotel management. He was happy to have a much smaller chain of luxury hotels than the giants in the mainstream market.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5f97" name="5f97">Strategy is and will always be about making choices. Integrative Thinking is about pushing yourself to get past unpleasant tradeoffs to positive tradeoffs of the sort that define and strengthen your strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="48b2" name="48b2"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Integrative Thinking in the Strategic Choice Structuring Process</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c507" name="c507">In terms of its link to strategy, Integrative Thinking is a tool that can be productively used in the possibilities generation stage of the Strategic Choice Structuring Process.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="dcc5" name="dcc5"><img class="graf-image" data-height="405" data-image-id="1*aeQ22PXpaWou6LVjOgIXZQ.png" data-width="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aeQ22PXpaWou6LVjOgIXZQ.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="bb43" name="bb43">The key to creating a winning strategy is to come up with a unique and hard-to-replicate cascade of winning aspiration, where to play, how to win, capabilities, and management systems choices. The limiting factor on the quality of an eventual strategy choice is the quality of the possibilities from which the strategy is drawn. Often, during the process of generating possibilities, tensions between possibilities arise — tradeoffs that are truly unpleasant. This is the point at which Integrative Thinking can be utilized.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="e56b" name="e56b"><img class="graf-image" data-height="405" data-image-id="1*DHO-FWomig3oHTWkEs0m8w.png" data-width="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DHO-FWomig3oHTWkEs0m8w.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="5e66" name="5e66">The exercise is to utilize the two opposing possibilities to creative a new possibility that overcomes the truly unpleasant tension. Piers Handling’s integrative possibility that turned the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) from an obscure, struggling festival to the most important film festival in the world provides an illustration. The two opposing possibilities were to maintain the inclusive community approach that TIFF had always embodied or to move to the exclusive industry approach that had long succeeded for the Cannes Film Festival. However, these two possibilities presented truly unpleasant tradeoffs to Handling. He loved the inclusivity of the festival, but the model caused it to endure unrelenting financial struggles. The exclusive industry model was financially attractive but entailed alienating the Toronto festival-going audience that Handling wanted to continue to embrace.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="aca1" name="aca1">To come up with an integrative possibility, Handling needed to understand how the two opposing models worked and what he loved about each.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="610e" name="610e"><img class="graf-image" data-height="405" data-image-id="1*QaJuEQEKLAlwyffJLkkaLQ.png" data-width="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QaJuEQEKLAlwyffJLkkaLQ.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="627b" name="627b">Handling loved what the inclusive community model did for the community, the industry and the festival but longed for the sponsorship revenue that arose out of the international media buzz that Cannes’ exclusive industry model provided. That gave him the insight to explore ways in which he could utilize attributes of the inclusive community model to generate the one thing that he wanted from the exclusive model.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e0d4" name="e0d4">That became the People’s Choice Award, an award that doubled down on the community aspect of TIFF by having the community serve as jury, not a group of industry elites as with Cannes’ Palm d’Or and leveraged the city of Toronto as a diverse multicultural test market for the global prospects of a film. Interestingly, the People’s Choice Award already existed but was not leveraged effectively as a game-changing tool.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="deb9" name="deb9">Once a new, integrative possibility is generated, it is treated like every other possibility. It is reverse engineered by asking what would have to be true (WWHTBT) for it to become a success. The things that would have to be true but are most worrisome are identified as the barriers to choosing that possibility. And a testing and transformation pathway is created to assess whether the barrier(s) can be overcome.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0f14" name="0f14">In the case of the Four Seasons integrative possibility above, the only way Sharp could test it was by creating a hotel that embodied his possibility. If that single hotel failed, it wouldn’t kill Four Seasons. And if it succeeded, it could be replicated across the world. That hotel was the Inn on the Park in Hyde Park, London and, as Sharp says, it was an instant success, the chain’s most profitable hotel for decades, and the model for all future Four Seasons hotels.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ccf2" name="ccf2">In the case of TIFF, the festival played up the People’s Choice award and when its winners started to succeed globally and win Academy Awards, the buzz generated by TIFF skyrocketed and Handling got more in the way of sponsorship revenues that he ever dreamed. If anything, the People’s Choice Award made TIFF more inclusive and, in due course, became the most sought-after award in the entire film festival season and a key to TIFF’s rise to prominence.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1b18" name="1b18"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Great-Choices-Integrative-Thinking/dp/1633692965/" href="https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Great-Choices-Integrative-Thinking/dp/1633692965/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Creating Great Choices</a> lays out the methodology for creating such integrative possibilities in much greater detail. There are three pathways of exploration for finding an integrative possibility including the ‘double-down’ pathway of TIFF, the ‘hidden gem’ pathway that Sharp used at Four Seasons, and a pathway we call ‘decomposition,’ exemplified by P&amp;G’s innovative Connect &amp; Develop approach to innovation. I was very pleased to see Creating Great Choices recently named one of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://bookauthority.org/books/best-decision-making-books?t=77sn3u&amp;s=author&amp;book=1633692965" href="https://bookauthority.org/books/best-decision-making-books?t=77sn3u&amp;s=author&amp;book=1633692965" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the 100 best decision-making books of all time</a>.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a418" name="a418"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insight</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e808" name="e808">Coming up with a truly winning possibility is a difficult task — a creative act. One way to come up with better possibilities is to use Integrative Thinking. The way to do so is to see conflicting possibilities that come up naturally in the process, not as the poles of a choice that needs to be made between incommensurable options, but rather as the raw materials necessary to create a better possibility still.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="145c" name="145c">To tease out those precious raw materials, do the exercise of figuring out how each model works for the relevant stakeholders. Identify what you would love to keep from each. Then work on how you could combine them in a novel way to produce a new model that contains elements of each but is superior to both. Then follow the Strategic Choice Structuring Process from there to bring the new model to life.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

In response, this PTW/PI is on the inseparability of Where-to-Play (WTP) and How-to-Win (HTW).</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="24e4" name="24e4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Pervasive Sequencing Error</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2d48" name="2d48">In the past couple of months, I have watched three separate PTW-loving organizations make the same fundamental error in the application of the Strategy Choice Cascade. The first was a national sports organization, the second a publicly traded biotech company, and the third a global consumer products company. In the first two cases, PTW enthusiasts came to me at the start of the process for informal advice as the creator of the strategy framework they had decided to use. In the third, my client asked me to review mid-course progress on a strategy project being performed for it by one of the world’s leading strategy consulting firms. These happened in such rapid succession that I decided I had to write about the phenomenon.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f8aa" name="f8aa">In each case, the project was laid out by way of modules of work leading up to workshops with the board of directors or the senior management team. In all three cases, there was research and analysis leading up to a workshop on WTP followed by another tranche of study leading up to a workshop on HTW. That is, there was full consideration first of WTP before the consideration of HTW.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bf59" name="bf59">I understand why this happens. The Strategy Choice Cascade visually flows from the upper left to the bottom right, which puts WTP ahead of HTW in the sequence of five questions. It is clear to me, 25 years after creating the model, that the visual cues are more powerful than I imagined at the time. Those cues signal: “Answer WTP first and then turn your mind to HTW.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2474" name="2474">Unfortunately, that drives a fundamental error in the application of the model. No matter how many times I caution against the error, it keeps happening. I sometimes wonder whether I should have put the two questions in a single box. But I don’t think so. They are logically separate questions. Putting them together wouldn’t solve the problem. There would, I believe, still be the tendency to consider them sequentially because that is the easiest thing to do. It simplifies the thinking. And it is consistent with the compartmentalization of modern business, by which business problems are chopped into narrow slices to tackle them and then assembled as if the pieces will fit together to make a whole. So, it probably feels natural.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fd77" name="fd77"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Matched Pair</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8cc0" name="8cc0">But it is a terrible way to make progress toward a strategy. WTP and HTW are an inseparably matched pair. Considering them separately does not create productive progress toward a strategy. This is because there is no inherently good (or bad) WTP. People tend to think that a WTP is attractive because it is big, or it is fast-growing, or it features high-margins or low levels of competition. China is often thought of as a highly attractive geographic WTP. But lots of companies, even the leading global ride-hailing company Uber, found it to be the opposite of attractive for them. Two of the world’s five most powerful companies, Google and Microsoft, both thought that the smartphone business was an exciting WTP — a fast-growing, technologically-sophisticated product, that was one of the biggest product markets in the world with billions of global users — and both acquired major smartphone businesses (from Motorola in 2012 and Nokia in 2014, respectively). But despite being tech giants, neither had a HTW for the smartphone business and within a couple of years, both were forced to exit with their tails between their legs and multi-billion-dollar write-offs. Paper companies are forever moving to higher-value-added grades of paper thinking those are great WTPs because prices there are higher, only to find that the higher prices are matched by even higher costs to serve against entrenched competitors. No WTP has merit without an accompanying HTW — and there is no exception to this rule.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="59f4" name="59f4">The worst thing to do is to lock and load on a single WTP before moving to the HTW stage. This happens surprisingly often in my experience. I get emails from people saying: “Roger, we have done our Winning Aspiration and chosen our WTP, but now we are terribly stuck on our HTW. What advice do you have for getting unstuck on HTW?” My answer is always to toss out the WTP and restart working on both WTP and HTW because if you are down to a single WTP, there likely isn’t a HTW for you that matches that particular WTP. If my personal career WTP was to be a National Basketball Association (NBA) player, there would be no available HTW for me other than to grow another 8 inches and replace my slow-twitch muscles with quick-twitch ones. So, like me, they are stuck for a reason. They have narrowed down WTP so far that there just isn’t a HTW to be found.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5517" name="5517">The next worst and probably most common approach is the generation of a list of WTP possibilities that then gets prioritized at a WTP workshop. In my experience, the list is typically very long — because in the absence of consideration of HTW, almost any WTP appears interesting. And if you combine this inclination with the modern fetish for ‘going for quantity’ in brainstorming, you get a really long list!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5fe8" name="5fe8">Such lists are unhelpful for strategy because the WTPs are purely theoretical without a paired HTW and since there are a lot of them, it is hard for the team doing the strategy work to focus its brainpower on possibilities that really matter — i.e., those for which a compelling HTW can be found.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ce73" name="ce73">With a long list of WTP possibilities in hand, the vast majority of which are irrelevant, the HTW workshop tends to be an exercise in going drone-like through the WTP possibilities and coming up with the best way to play in each. Again, my experience is that because the HTW task is diffused in this way, the team rarely comes up with a fabulous HTW to pair with one of the WTP possibilities because it never focuses enough on the finding that ideal pair. It is not as though it doesn’t ever happen. It is just far less likely.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="56c3" name="56c3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Better Way</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="14df" name="14df">Though the thought process is more daunting, the better way is to look for WTP/HTW pairs. When a potential WTP possibility comes to mind, immediately ask: is there a HTW that would make this a winning combination? And if not, could the WTP be tweaked to make for a better pair? If not, then discard the WTP entirely and move on. Don’t add it to a list of useless WTP options. It is this process of back and forth between WTP ideas and potential HTW matches that creates something real and powerful at the heart of strategy: the WTP/HTW matched pair.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bfde" name="bfde">It is an iterative process. The search needs to be patient because the prize is great: a HTW that is perfectly suited to its WTP; a WTP that by its limitations makes the HTW the strongest it can be. The Southwest Airlines WTP of short haul flights between secondary airports, featuring a single class of service enabled the HTW of the lowest cost airline in America. Longer hauls and multiple classes of service would have been a WTP that would have weakened the HTW — making the overall pair weaker. The Four Seasons WTP of hotel management (not hotel development and ownership) in the luxury space enabled the HTW of a distinctive form of service delivered in medium-sized hotels. A broader WTP would have damaged the power of the HTW.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4c49" name="4c49">The separation of this naturally matched pair simply makes the creation of strategy less effective with no other benefit than the thinking process is easier — hardly a worthwhile tradeoff.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2284" name="2284"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insight</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f924" name="f924">Never forget that WTP and HTW are an inseparably matched pair — and are the heart of strategy. Any decoupling of them will make your strategy weaker — so don’t, even if it feels easier. Tackle the challenge of creating a matched pair. And never makes lists of potential WTPs. Consider the HTW for every WTP before moving on to the consideration of another WTP.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="9598" name="9598">Consider your Winning Aspiration. But don’t hold onto it tightly until you have created a linkage with your WTP/HTW pair. Toggle back and forth to forge a match between your Winning Aspiration and your WTP/HTW pair. No Winning Aspiration has any merit if it can’t be matched with a WTP/HTW pair. And then do the reality check to ensure that you can build the Capabilities and the Management Systems to bring alive the WPT/HTW pair. And if you can’t, go back and tweak the WTP/HTW pair until you can. That is how you build a great strategy centered on an inseparable WTP/HTW matched pair.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

In my 14th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece, I will argue that presiding over strategy is a dangerous trap, which general managers and their organizations need to avoid. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ded2" name="ded2"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Rise of Managerialism</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9099" name="9099">The concept of management has been around for a long time. Greek philosopher <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Xenophon-Memorabilia-Oeconomicus-Symposium-Classical/dp/067499695X/" href="https://www.amazon.com/Xenophon-Memorabilia-Oeconomicus-Symposium-Classical/dp/067499695X/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Socrates discussed it extensively</a> in the 4th century BC and even declared it to be a respectable calling in a departure from his usual distain for things economic! But for most of history, businesses were small, and most managers split their time between managing and delivering the product/service, which is still the case for today’s small businesses. But over time, businesses grew to great size, especially when the Industrial Revolution opened the doors for large-scale manufacturing. The sprawling companies that have emerged since have needed more coordination and control, augmenting the importance of management, and creating ever larger cadres of managers who don’t produce the product/service but supervise others who do so.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3f71" name="3f71">This trend accelerated in the 20th century as companies got bigger and bigger. Management also became more codified as scholars including Max Weber, Peter Drucker and Henry Fayol studied and wrote about the practice. In his 1916 classic <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/General-Industrial-Management-Henri-Fayol/dp/1614274592/" href="https://www.amazon.com/General-Industrial-Management-Henri-Fayol/dp/1614274592/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">General and Industrial Management</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">, </em>Fayol described the five functions of management: planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating, and controlling. Harvard Business School (HBS) opened its doors in 1908 and taught business administration, playing a leading role in making management an academic discipline. A key aspect of the advance in business thinking during the 20th century was the codification of the legitimate role for presiding over and organizing the work of others.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="652a" name="652a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Intensification of Specialization</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1142" name="1142">At the same time that managerialism was rising, specialization within the business domain was intensifying. In the early 20th century, companies tended to be functionally organized and business schools mirrored their structure in teaching business. MBA students could expect their core courses to have names like: Marketing, Finance, Production, Human Resources, and Accounting. Interestingly that particular structure of business education continued even after the vast majority of large companies switched from functional organizations to business unit structures organized around product/service lines. Even though business schools like Harvard Business School claimed from its outset to teach ‘general management,’ a quick look it its first-year core curriculum reveals that even today only two of the ten required courses (one on entrepreneurship and one on ethics) plus a required field study deviate from the teaching of a narrow functional specialty.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2457" name="2457">Moreover, the entire business school academy is organized around the narrow functional specialties with its referred journals encouraging research and writing within the functional disciplines. After a century of such academic work within functions, the knowledge domains are deep, making it hard to be considered an expert without focusing entirely on mastering the knowledge within one functional domain.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7b86" name="7b86">As a result, general managers are encouraged to believe that they don’t know enough about the narrow and deep specialist domains to make decisions in them. That is, the CFO has far superior subject matter expertise in finance decisions, the CHRO in human resources decisions, the CTO in technology decisions, the CLO in legal decisions, etc.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7b7b" name="7b7b"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Presiding, not Engaging</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2f49" name="2f49">When the rise of managerialism and the intensification of specialization are combined, it is no surprise to see general managers tempted to conceive of their job as presiding over the organization rather than engaging in its daily life, with an emphasis on the commanding, coordinating, and controlling parts of Fayol’s list. The general manager tells the functional specialists what output is required — I need a compensation plan, I need a budget, etc. — and then monitors to make sure the output is produced as ordered.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="eed7" name="eed7"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Coming of Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0b05" name="0b05">Fayol’s 1916 list included planning, but that was long before the coming of strategy to business. Fayol saw planning as the key managerial function, without which the other four functions would be largely unguided. He saw planning as centrally concerned with considering alternative courses of action and choosing the best one, a worthy antecedent to the concept of business strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="be11" name="be11">After strategy became a business phenomenon outside the business school establishment with Bruce Henderson’s creation of Boston Consulting Group in 1963 and the subsequent massive success and growth of the nascent strategy consulting industry in the 1960s and 1970s, it became a legitimate subject of study within business schools as exemplified by Michael Porter’s wildly successful HBS second year elective Industry &amp; Competitive Analysis based on his 1980 best seller <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Competitive Strategy</em>. It was by far and away the most popular elective during my second year at HBS (1980–1981), but not yet a part of the core required curriculum because new subjects from the real world tend to take a decade or two to achieve legitimacy in the business academic world.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8927" name="8927">In an important respect, strategy was a threat to the other disciplines because it began its life as a horizontal overlay on top of the vertical functional slices — i.e., how one might bring together marketing, finance, operations, etc. to make general management decisions. The response of the business academy over the past forty years has been, slowly but surely, to rotate strategy ninety degrees to make it yet another vertical discipline with a deep body of specialist knowledge and analytical techniques, written about in refereed A-journals like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Strategic Management Journal </em>(which commenced publication in 1980, nearly two decades after the foundation of the strategy consulting industry).</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f85e" name="f85e">Unsurprisingly, this verticalization has been mirrored in the corporate world where strategy has become just another function like Finance, HR, IT, and Legal. In the early days, firms had a Vice-President of Strategy, but now the position has been elevated to the C-suite with most big companies featuring a Chief Strategy Officer (CSO). Because of their newfound prominence, lots is written about CSOs, like <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/operations/articles/making-of-a-successful-chief-strategy-officer.html" href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/operations/articles/making-of-a-successful-chief-strategy-officer.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this good piece by Deloitte describing the six most common roles of a CSO</a>.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3111" name="3111"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Presiding Over Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f569" name="f569">The functionalization of strategy has had the predictable effect of causing many general managers to add strategy to the list of functions over which they preside. Just as they ask their CFO for a budget and their CIO for an IT plan and their CHRO for a compensation plan, they ask their CSO for a strategy because, they believe, as with the other functional specialists, the CSO has proprietary subject matter expertise that a general manager cannot hope to master in the modern era of specialization. Of course, this is not universally the case; but it happens far too frequently in my view.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="96e1" name="96e1">To me, presiding not engaging is a general management mistake across the board. It allows controlling C<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">X</em>Os to use the bafflegab of specialized language systems to push for decisions in their domains that make them happy but aren’t in the interests of the whole company — with CIOs/CTOs as the most frequent abusers on this front. General managers need to suck it up and learn enough of the specialized language systems and analytical tools to engage in, not just preside over, the work of these functional heads.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e7bb" name="e7bb">But is even more critical in the case of strategy. Strategy is the integrative discipline — it is general management itself, despite the position into which it has been pushed by the jealous functional disciplines. To me, presiding over strategy instead of engaging directly in it represents the abdication of general management responsibility. If I was a board member and our CEO informed us that the CSO had created our strategy, I would lose all faith in the CEO and believe that we didn’t actually have a real CEO.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="df7b" name="df7b">This is not to say that the CSO can’t or shouldn’t play a significant role in the development of the strategy. I particularly like combination of two of Deloitte’s ‘six faces of the CSO:’ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">engineer</em> who designs and runs the strategic planning process; and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">advisor</em> who helps shape the strategy. In my experience, a great CSO/strategy organization can provide invaluable help to an engaged CEO or business-unit general manager. But no matter how good they are, they can’t save a general manager who chooses to simply preside over the production of strategy. Sadly, that ‘general manager,’ whether lower-level or CEO, is actually a bureaucrat not a general manager!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="007e" name="007e"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insight</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8b04" name="8b04">If you are a general manager, don’t follow the trend toward managerialism over the precipice of ubiquitous presiding. And don’t be intimidated by the intense specialization within functions into believing that you don’t have the requisite subject matter expertise to engage in strategy development. Not only can you do it, but you must in order to lead on the most general managerial of tasks. Use your CSO for help: lean on him/her for process and content expertise. But don’t abdicate. Strategy is a line responsibility, and you are the line person in charge.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="14e2" name="14e2">If you are a strategy function specialist, don’t let your boss abdicate strategy responsibility. Resist the temptation to do what the worst functional C<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">X</em>O’s do and attempt to make your domain intimidating and impenetrable. Your job is to help your general manager boss to get better at strategy, to engage in it with you, and to add value to it. If you do so, you will reap three benefits: 1) your business will have better strategy; 2) you will have helped your general manager became a more valuable executive; and 3) by osmosis, you will have learned valuable lessons in general management.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

(Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4756" name="4756">I get asked the question because Playing to Win was cowritten with former P&amp;G CEO AG Lafley and uses P&amp;G to illustrate the strategy concepts in the book. The logic behind the question is that P&amp;G is B2C and therefore this technique applies only to B2C and one would have to use a different framework for B2B because B2B is so different.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="000c" name="000c">The question is somewhat peculiar because while most casual observers think of P&amp;G as selling to consumers, it does very little of that. In fact, technically it is almost entirely a B2B business with well over 90% of its sales to corporations, such as Walmart, Target, Carrefour, Metro, Tesco, Walgreens and Amazon. In fact, it has been working very hard in recent years to build a Direct-to-Consumer business — which would actually make it more of a B2C company. And while some may typecast me as a B2C guy, the companies with which I work are split equally between B2C companies (including P&amp;G for purposes of this split), entirely B2B companies, and companies whose sales are nearly equally split between B2C and B2B.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="655e" name="655e">If you have read my earlier Medium post, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://roger-78069.medium.com/avoiding-the-pitfalls-of-our-same-different-impulse-de75ab05a521" href="https://roger-78069.medium.com/avoiding-the-pitfalls-of-our-same-different-impulse-de75ab05a521" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Avoiding the Pitfalls of Our Same-Different Impulse</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">,</em> you will probably have guessed by now that I will argue that this is a case in which the overwhelming tendency is to highlight and accentuate the differences between B2B and B2C — and that is a mistake. Indeed, while I would never argue that they are the same, I believe that B2B strategy is more like B2C strategy than not.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cbfe" name="cbfe">There are three ways that people argue to me that B2B and B2C strategy are markedly different. Each, to me, ignores the greater similarities.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bd39" name="bd39"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">In B2B Strategy, You Don’t Have to Think about the End-Consumer</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fcc3" name="fcc3">The pushback that I get when I cite P&amp;G as a B2B company is that retail is a special case because retailer does not transform the purchased input in any way but rather just serves as a channel to the consumer. This is true, but it does not negate the fact that a lot of value can be creating by thinking about the end-consumer just as you would in a B2C business.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="216c" name="216c">In 1986, the primarily B2B chemical giant Dupont launched a new product in the carpet category: Stainmaster. Dupont had done enough consumer research to know that the biggest unmet carpet user need was a carpet that resisted permanent staining when accidents happened. Dupont launched Stainmaster with a big advertising campaign and Stainmaster went on to become the most well-known and valued carpet brand in America. The fascinating thing about Stainmaster carpets is that Dupont didn’t make them. It only made carpet fibers — which it sold to carpet manufacturers, who utilized them to produce carpets which they sold as Stainmaster carpets. While Dupont’s carpet business was entirely B2B, its strategy was largely indistinguishable from a B2C strategy. [In due course this changed, especially when Dupont sold the business to Koch Industries in 2003.]</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ea60" name="ea60">Intel came to a similar understanding but only after a tough lesson. In 1993, it famously lost a court battle to stop rival chipmaker AMD from selling logic chips called ‘486’ which Intel argued was its proprietary brand name. The judge ruled against Intel and was dismissive of Intel’s position. To the judge, Intel treated the ‘486’ moniker as merely a technical specification and had done nothing to make it a brand name. So, he ruled that AMD had every right to use it. Intel learned a lesson and the next generation would not be a 586 chip: it would be a Pentium, accompanied by a large advertising campaign that told the consumer that regardless of what computer they bought, they should want to have ‘Intel Inside.’</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dc47" name="dc47">Similarly, why do you care that a Bosch fuel injection system was installed as part of the engine in your car — and why would you be open to paying more in that case? Why do you care that your lawn mower has a Briggs &amp; Stratton engine? The reason is that both of those B2B companies thought like B2C companies. Both invested in understanding the needs and interests of end consumers of the product into which their component was incorporated and built a consumer-recognized brand. And both extract value from their direct customer by having created pull with the consumer, just like P&amp;G does.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8ee5" name="8ee5">Can all B2B businesses build end-consumer pull-through? No. But virtually every B2B company that takes the time to understand its customer’s customers will find strategy possibilities and nuances that they wouldn’t have seen if they focused only on their immediate customer.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="71b6" name="71b6"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">In B2B Strategy, You are Selling to Businesses, not to People</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="81ae" name="81ae">The inference is that B2B strategy is different because the key skill is understanding and selling to a business not understanding and selling to a person. While it is technically true that a business pays your invoice, the difference is not nearly as great as this line of argumentation suggests. Even though the payor is a business, you are almost always selling to a specific person or identifiable group of people in that business. And they need to be understood in ways that are similar to those in B2C.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="85e7" name="85e7">They have wants and needs just like individual consumers. They won’t buy unless you meet their individual wants and needs. I remember vividly doing work on a strategy for penetrating the small airport segment for a leading supplier of air traffic control systems to large airports. When I suggested doing some ethnographic research and developing personas for the managers of these smaller airports, the client was perplexed, thinking of the purchase as a technical question: did our system meet the published specifications or not? I convinced them to do the work and they learned that these managers had needs and wants that went beyond the spec sheets and were different than those in its traditional large airport customers. These managers felt more alone and exposed if something went wrong because they didn’t have a big technical/IT staff to support them. As a result, they cared much more about the ongoing support they felt they would experience from their provider. They knew that they would have everyone shouting at them if the system went down. If that wasn’t strongly signaled during the sales process, it wouldn’t matter a whit if the provider met everything on the spec sheets.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1426" name="1426">In my experience, deep understanding of the customer is more similar than different in B2B versus B2C and as important in B2B as in B2C. In the modern corporation, the central procurement function attempts to interpose itself between the provider and the actual user within the business. But that just raises the importance of deeply understanding both the people in the central procurement function and the actual user group. Those procurement folks are people too, not some corporate monolith.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7644" name="7644"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">In B2B, Only Cost Leadership Strategies Work</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7319" name="7319">This argument, somewhat less frequently made, is that since you are selling to a business, you are selling against a formal specification and the only way to gain an advantage is to have a lower cost position than competitors and therefore be able to sell at the established price and earn more than competitors or to be able to undercut competitors while earning as much as them. That is certainly one approach to a winning strategy, exactly as it is in B2C.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="49df" name="49df">But it most certainly is not the only way. Differentiation is equally possible — and is almost identical to differentiation in a B2C context. A firm can differentiate with a consumer in three ways: 1) lower the cost of consumers doing something they do already (e.g., a more fuel-efficient car); 2) enable consumers to do better something they already do (e.g., feel better about how they look with a pair of designer jeans); 3) enable consumers to do something that they can’t do now (e.g., find a Pez dispenser for your collection that would otherwise be unfindable).</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7239" name="7239">The same three ways hold for business customers: 1) e.g., paper stock that runs faster and more reliably on the customer’s paper machines; or an online service that enables them to do legal searches with fewer resources; 2) e.g., paper stock that enables the customer to do better quality printing than previously; or a customer relationship management system that enables the customer to serve its customers better; 3) e.g., paper that enables the customer to package a product that it couldn’t effectively package previously; or a telematics system that enables the customer to know for the first time where each of its delivery trucks is in real time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="67e7" name="67e7">On this front, B2B and B2C aren’t just similar: they are the same.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4935" name="4935"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="937f" name="937f">If you are doing strategy in a B2B context, don’t be fooled into thinking the principles that you should apply are vastly different than the principles in a B2C context. Your default assumption should be that unless you can see a specific way in which B2B strategy is different, it is likely to be the same. That means you should pay attention to your customer’s customers to have the best insights on how your strategy can add value to your customer. And think about whether there is an opportunity to build brand recognition with your customer’s customers as part of your strategy. It also means recognizing that you are still selling to people even if they are working at a business. Take the time to understand the people as well as you would attempt to understand consumers in a classic B2C business. And finally, keep in mind that the entire spectrum of low cost and differentiation possibilities for winning in B2C is available in B2B businesses.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

If I stop to do strategy, we will get left behind. Plus, there is so much uncertainty and change in our industry that it is impossible to analyze any data about it anyway, so even if I wanted to do strategy, I can’t. I just have to act.” This is particularly standard fare in technology industries. That is why I am dedicating my 16th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) to My Business is Too Fast-Moving for Strategy. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="feba" name="feba">Businesspeople say non-sensical things about strategy all the time, so this response doesn’t really surprise or bother me. But I find it grating the degree to which it said with the implication that the person is being tough-minded and practical in the face of an unrealistic and theoretical expectation for ‘a strategy.’ In my view, the response embodies two fundamental fallacies about strategy: a false distinction between strategy and acting; and a misconception of the structure and role of analysis in strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p" id="b962" name="b962"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“I just act” IS Your Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7baa" name="7baa">As I have argued previously, strategy isn’t analysis, strategy isn’t plans, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/an-idea/strategy-is-what-you-do-not-what-you-say-a6e483840557" href="https://medium.com/an-idea/strategy-is-what-you-do-not-what-you-say-a6e483840557" target="_blank">strategy is what you do</a>! So, when you claim you ‘just do,’ you are, in fact, describing your strategy. You have a strategy and whether you acknowledge that or not is irrelevant. You have decided to do some things and not other things. You have decided where you will play and how you will compete. It might be a good set of choices or a bad set of choices or an indifferent set of choices. But it is your set of strategy choices.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="90ad" name="90ad">It doesn’t matter in what kind of hurry you are or how unclear the future is. You have made choices and you have a strategy: and it is your strategy. There are no excuses as to whose it is. The only question is how robust the thinking behind your chosen actions is? And that leads into the second fallacy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="108c" name="108c"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Two Components of Analysis</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5b9c" name="5b9c">The rationale I am given by the too-fast-moving-for-strategy folks is that they don’t have time for the data collection necessary for strategy and/or there isn’t actually data about their industry to crunch because it is so nascent/fast-changing. The implicit assumption is that without the crunching of data, you can’t do strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b658" name="b658">This view unhelpfully conflates the two components of analysis. Analysis is the application of data to a logical structure to assess the degree to which the logical structure is confirmed or not. The first component is a logical structure (or hypothesis if you prefer) — for example, bigger plants can spread fixed costs across more units of production and therefore have a lower cost structure. The second component is data applied to the logical structure — for example, we gather cost data on 100 plants of varying sizes.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f095" name="f095">The resource-intensive component of analysis is data collection. It typically takes a great deal of elapsed time to collect data and the task is often quite expensive. Big corporations will tend to do lots of data collection — market research studies, competitor analyses, simulations, cost studies — in an attempt to achieve more rigorous support of the logical structure. As I have <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/management-is-much-more-than-a-science" href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/management-is-much-more-than-a-science" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed out</a> (<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2020/10/leaders-need-to-harness-aristotles-3-types-of-knowledge" href="https://hbr.org/2020/10/leaders-need-to-harness-aristotles-3-types-of-knowledge" rel="noopener" target="_blank">repeatedly</a>) before, there are limitations to data collection and application in any event. There isn’t actually data about the future in any situation — whether fast-moving or not — and the future can be different from the past limiting the value of any data from the past. In my experience, big corporations tend to spend more time and money than is optimal on collecting data to utilize in analyses.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="93a6" name="93a6">Hence in a fast-moving/quickly changing context, there is plenty of excuse for not investing substantially in the data collection component of analysis. However, there is simply no excuse for not thinking through the strategy logic structure. It doesn’t take much time — especially elapsed time — to think through the strategy logic. It just takes hard thinking using a rigorous strategy framework — like Playing to Win (though it is by no means the only such framework). But because most conflate the two components of analysis, they toss out both of them together in a fast-moving context even if only one (data collection) is really a problem.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6b47" name="6b47"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Better Way</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bbc3" name="bbc3">The better way, regardless of how fast-moving or sluggish your industry, is to invest hard thinking in developing your strategic logic structure. It needn’t take long. It just requires total concentration and the avoidance of distractions — like analyzing stuff. And it is important to write it down — even if you are too shy to share it with anybody else. The only way you can learn and get better is to prospectively write down your logic and then after you put it in action, you will be able to see how well your logic stood up. If you don’t write down your logic, mark my words, you will ex post rationalize that you had it totally right even when you most certainly did not, and you won’t have learned a thing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8998" name="8998">Then, do only as much data collection against the logic as makes sense in your particular context. If it is fast-moving and emergent, then you might forego data collection entirely and just go with your logic. But prioritize. There may be particular areas in the logic that you could test and would find sufficiently valuable to spend the time and resources. View data collection as a variable that you adjust to the context.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c3e6" name="c3e6">In my experience, the investment pattern is the opposite regardless of the context. The strategic logic structure is given short shrift while <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ1rjGSHBEM" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ1rjGSHBEM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">useless bureaucratic data collection exercises like SWOT</a> are pursued. And more time still is spent on fantasies like <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2014/01/the-big-lie-of-strategic-planning" href="https://hbr.org/2014/01/the-big-lie-of-strategic-planning" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revenue budgeting</a>. Millions of person-hours are spent every year on revenue budgets when the company has zero control over revenue. Customers control revenue while the company controls expenses. Yet companies budget for revenue as if it is in their control — a delusional and largely useless part of the overall strategic planning process for most companies.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="28b4" name="28b4">All of this data collection takes away focus from the most important aspect of strategy — coming up with the strategic logic. There is no excuse for that.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ce66" name="ce66">And I put my money where my mouth is (as I always attempt to do) on this front. My only corporate equity investments are in early-stage private ventures. And on that front, I will only invest in start-ups that can lay out a compelling strategy logic for me. I don’t care about them showing a big total addressable market. I don’t even read the revenue forecasts because they are just made up. I care almost exclusively if they have a Where-to-Play/How-to-Win (WTP/HTW) combination that feels compelling to me.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1a88" name="1a88">I have made about twenty such investments, all of which could be accurately described as being in fast-moving technology businesses, ten of which are still active investments. I have, of course, made mistakes in which the data evolved inconsistently with the logic, meaning that the logic was fatally flawed. However, more than twice as many investments have achieved a payoff/valuation of greater than 2X (with some above 10X) than have produced either a payoff lower than 2X or a loss.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c531" name="c531">But I need to confess that before the above, I had to learn a very painful lesson. I began doing early-stage technology investing through an intermediary who convinced me he was a genius early-stage investor. I contributed an amount to his latest fund (of a size that was painful to lose), which made investments in eight companies. He celebrated me as one of his investors — the ‘strategy guru’ — and convinced me to give a talk on strategy at his first annual investor conference. After giving my talk, I listened to the founder/CEOs of the eight companies. I blanched as I listened. I went to the genius investor at the end of the night and asked him what he was thinking: they were all losers? Of course, he disagreed entirely. But, sadly, I turned out to be right. All were busts and the fund and my investment literally went to zero.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9786" name="9786">I learned an expensive lesson: focus on and audit the strategic logic yourself or don’t even think about investing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ed97" name="ed97"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8c72" name="8c72">There is no escape from making strategy choices, so don’t act as if you are not making them regardless of your context. The only question is how to make them best? If your context is fast-moving/quickly changing, focus hard on the strategy logic. Make sure you have a WTP/HTW theory and write it down. If you don’t have time and/or resources to collect data to test the theory, then just put your theory in practice.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2d5c" name="2d5c">Watch what happens and compare the outcomes to what your theory predicted. And then adjust. But again, think carefully about the new WTP/HTW, applying all the new data to which you have access thanks to the passage of time. Write down the new strategic logic. Put your updated theory into practice.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="7c4e" name="7c4e">And watch again, and then adjust again, and then put it in practice again, and so on. That is how to do strategy in a fast-moving industry!</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

This was far from the first time that particular question has been asked, so I thought I would do this, my 17th Playing to Win Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI)on the topic of Playing to Win &amp; Scenario Planning. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a828" name="a828"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Some History &amp; Context</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4857" name="4857">Like many business tools, scenario planning started life in the military. Its origins are generally attributed to physicist Herman Kahn who introduced the tool to the US military in the 1950s while consulting to the military from the Rand Corporation. He argued that the US military would reduce vulnerability by imagining and planning for more than a single likely battle threat.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cc2d" name="cc2d">The technique migrated to the business world in the 1970s and much is made of the successes Royal Dutch Shell had using scenario planning in and around the two OPEC-induced hikes in the price of oil — 4X in 1973–1974 and 2X in 1979–1980. These events altered asset values dramatically, and Shell was reportedly much better prepared because its scenarios included potential discontinuous action by OPEC.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2a0b" name="2a0b">Now scenario planning is in widespread practice. Twenty-five years ago, if a management team brought a scenario analysis to its Board, it would have had a good chance of being asked: “What the hell is that?” Now, if it doesn’t, the Board is more likely to ask: “Where is your scenario analysis?” Now, there are numerous individuals and firms that offer scenario planning services and education, like the one whose matrix is shown above.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cbfb" name="cbfb">In my experience, there is one downside to scenario planning, and it is actually a similar downside to Five-Forces Analysis in the early 1980s and SWOT analysis right up to the present. That weakness is that it is analysis for analysis sake and there is no prescriptive “so what.” I remember in the very early days of Monitor Company, when Mike Porter’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Competitive Strategy </em>book was in its greatest glory as the first business best-seller, companies would come to us to do a Five-Forces Analysis for them — just like they read about in the book. And we dutifully and excitedly did one for them — or one for each business. At first, clients were happy, but then they started asking: “OK, we know the structural attractiveness is medium-high, what now?” As a result, we had to develop a real strategy practice!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a38c" name="a38c">This continues to be the case for SWOT analysis to this very day. It is the least actionable and useful analysis in all of strategy. And it can be the case for scenario analysis. It is cool. There can be interesting insights. But only if it is tied directly into the strategy process is it a truly valuable exercise.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d796" name="d796">In my view and experience, scenario planning can be productively integrated into the strategy choice structuring process in three ways/at three stages in it as follows:</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="4dfe" name="4dfe"><img class="graf-image" data-height="304" data-image-id="1*EkH-_jqqWiAjBvUMdBinjQ.png" data-width="540" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EkH-_jqqWiAjBvUMdBinjQ.png"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin, 2020</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="07c6" name="07c6"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1)</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A More Robust Definition of the Problem</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1f33" name="1f33">I have argued previously in the series that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/strategy-as-problem-solving-5c6fb9291d87" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/strategy-as-problem-solving-5c6fb9291d87" target="_blank">strategy is a problem-solving exercise</a>. As such, the quality of the output of a strategy exercise is gated by the robustness of the definition of the problem. If the problem definition doesn’t capture the real problem, then the strategy will solve a problem that may not matter. [And remember, an unexploited opportunity is as much of a problem as a threat to the business.]</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3a02" name="3a02">For example, in the late 1970s, GM/Ford/Chrysler defined the strategic problem behind the growing penetration of Japanese autos into the US market as the Japanese OEMs having small cars while Detroit didn’t. The strategy prescription was to rush smaller cars to market. Lack of a small car line-up indeed was part of the problem. But the real problem was the poor and declining quality, reliability, and durability (QRD) of US automobiles in the face of dramatically improving QRD from the Japanese producers — especially Toyota. The rush to get small cars to market, resulted in the GM launch of its infamous X-car lineup for the 1980 model year, a lineup that included the first new car I ever bought — a 1980 Pontiac Phoenix. The QRD of the X-cars was so disastrously bad that it both widened the QRD gap with the ascending Japanese OEMs and convinced an entire generation of car buyers (me included) that they could never trust GM. The fix of the secondary problem made the real problem much worse.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="41e4" name="41e4">I often get asked, how do you know you have defined the right problem? My answer is that you never know for certain, in part because it isn’t a binary thing: right or wrong. The problem definition is just better or worse. That is why I urge repeatedly adjusting the problem definition as you go through the Strategic Choice Structuring Process and gain new insights as to the nature of the problem.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1dbe" name="1dbe">But another technique for generating a more robust problem definition is scenario planning. It can expose problems that don’t arise out of simple linear extrapolation of current conditions — as was OPEC flexing its muscles as never before with its embargo of the US (and several other countries) in 1973.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4c1a" name="4c1a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2)</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Richer Motivating How Might We Question</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="192b" name="192b">A more robust definition of the problem can lead directly to a motivating how-might-we-question (HMWQ) that is richer. For example, if one has a scenario planning exercise in hand, it may be more possible to have a HMWQ such as: How might we position ourselves to win big if the world evolves as Scenario A, while giving us the time and capacity to adjust if it evolves to Scenario D, the most problematic scenario for us. That HMWQ would be difficult if not impossible to formulate without some form of scenario planning exercise.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="663a" name="663a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3)</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A More Comprehensive Range of Possibilities</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c6e1" name="c6e1">Perhaps the most valuable contribution to strategy of scenario planning is that it should help ensure a more comprehensive range of possibilities. One of the challenges in strategy is generating a broad and comprehensive range of strategic possibilities. The easiest ones to come up with are the ones that are closest to a linear extrapolation of the present.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="383e" name="383e">However, if a scenario planning exercise comes up with the classic four scenarios based on two opposing variables (as above), each can be used as a motivator to search for a possibility for winning under each of the four scenarios. In my experience, it is motivational because if you can’t come up with any way of winning under one particular scenario, it means that the company is completely vulnerable if the world evolves to that scenario. Typically, a group motivated in this fashion can come up with at least one legitimate possibility for each scenario. It is my experience that one or more of the resultant possibilities wouldn’t have occurred to the team had it not been motivated by the existence of the scenarios.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4a0b" name="4a0b"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">4)</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">An Added Bonus</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9ed0" name="9ed0">As you may recall, the strategy process involves reverse engineering each of the possibilities by asking the question: what would have to be true (WWHTBT) for the possibility to be the optimal choice? That is, what would have to be true about the industry dynamics, customer needs, company capabilities/cost position, and competitor moves? I encourage the team responsible for the strategy to take the WWHTBT analysis from the chosen option and tack it up in front of their desk because it serves as a great early-warning indicator — the proverbial canary in the coal mine. If any morning, you come to work and you assess the WWHTBT as ceasing to be entirely true, you have been given an early warning that you need to reassess your strategy choice — sooner rather than later.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d09d" name="d09d">When you do scenario planning as part of strategy, it enables you to do a more comprehensive version of this. You can identify the optimal strategy choice for each scenario. Then instead of tacking up the single WWHTBT in front of your desk, tack up all four (or whatever number of scenarios you used). If you ask which of these WWHTBT seem to be trending in a direction of being most true, you will get an early indicator of which scenario is coming to fruition, and that can give you a valuable jump on shifting course.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="80cb" name="80cb"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5e15" name="5e15">Scenario planning can be a valuable tool, but only if it is diligently tied to strategy development. Use the scenarios generated to come up with a more robust definition of the problem and a richer HMWQ. Then, when generating possibilities, make sure that you don’t stop until you have a winning possibility under each scenario.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="db1c" name="db1c">Instead of just keeping the WWHTBT for the chosen strategic possibility for daily scrutiny, keep the WWHTBT for the leading possibility under each scenario. That way, if the WWHTBT for your chosen strategy is trending toward being less true while the WWHTBT for a possibility under another scenario is trending toward being truer, you can start the process of considering whether to shift to that possibility because it looks as though a different scenario than the one you assumed under your initial choice is emerging. And if that scenario does come to dominate, it may well be imperative to shift strategy — sooner rather than later.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Martin, 2021</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="ae00" name="ae00">Many people tell me they find confusing the distinction between How-to-Win (HTW) and Capabilities — and I recognize this confusion manifested in the Strategic Choice Cascades that they show me. Is our direct-store-delivery (DSD) system a HTW or a Capability? Is data a HTW or Capability? What about talent? And if we put that in the HTW box, what do we put in the Capabilities box? Aren’t HTW and Capabilities both about winning so why do we need both? Because of all these questions, I have decided to write my 18th Playing to Win Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece on Distinguishing How-to-Win from Capabilities in Your Strategy Choice. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="67f4" name="67f4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How-to-Win: The Can’t/Won’t Test</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="134b" name="134b">The simplest way to think about your HTW choice is that it is your theory of how you will be better than the competition. That is why simply positing a strength — like a strong DSD system, lots of data or impressive talent is not a HTW. It isn’t a theory of advantage. It just claims that you have that thing. It could actually be a theory of advantage. But that would only be the case if you can specify how it will make you meaningfully better than competition. For that, I use <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the can’t/won’t test</em></strong>. For your theory of advantage to be robust, you must have a compelling argument as to why either competitors <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t</em></strong> match your advantage even if they want to or <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">won’t</em></strong> match your advantage even if they can.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1298" name="1298">For example, while a strong DSD system is not a generic theory of advantage, Frito Lay’s DSD system is central to its theory of advantage. It goes something like this: In the salty snacks business, a large cost item is the cost of a shelf DSD system — in which the product is delivered to the store itself (often a convenience store) and placed on the shelf by the delivery driver, who also takes back and accounts for stales. It is labor-intensive and each stop is expensive. Frito Lay has by far and away the largest array of leading salty snack brands (plus some sweet snack ones too): Lays, Doritos, Cheetos, Ruffles, Fritos, Tostitos, Rold Gold, Smart Food and so on. The resulting economies of scale for each DSD truck stop creates a massive cost advantage for Frito Lay that the competitors can’t come close to matching. Plus, it creates a convenience advantage for the store owner of having fewer trucks stopping to stock the shelves. That is a theory of advantage.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="09e6" name="09e6">While having lots of data is itself not a theory of advantage, WestLaw’s case database and the system that organizes the cases is core to its theory of advantage. Founded in 1882, West Publishing Company started the practice of creating short ‘headnotes’ for cases coming out of the Minnesota court system to enable lawyers to more efficiently sort through cases to determine which were and were not relevant to the legal matter at hand. In due course, West expanded to court cases across the US and created the West American Digest System to classify all cases more formally by key content attributes. In due course, it became the West Key Number System, which is such an industry standard that it is taught to students in law schools across America. In 1975, West Publishing began a journey from a publisher of legal casebooks to the online service, WestLaw, and is now a fully digital, online provider of legal search services, a field it dominates.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="763e" name="763e">WestLaw’s theory of advantage is that it not only has a more comprehensive database of cases than any other provider, but it also has had its staff attorneys writing consistently structured headnotes for the cases for a century, and thanks to those headnotes and the proprietary West Key Number System, lawyers using WestLaw can do faster, less expensive and more accurate searches than in any other way. Competitors can’t match that advantage because it would entail going back a century and creating headnotes for hundreds of thousands of cases and, in addition, creating a search system that is so superior to West Key Number System that it would cause users familiar with the industry standard to abandon and switch. That too is a theory of advantage.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="aaa1" name="aaa1">While having impressive talent is not an advantage, McKinsey’s track record of elevating careers produces a talent-based advantage for it. I got a window this advantage the hard way when I attempted to recruit a whip-smart graduating Rhodes Scholar to Monitor Company in the early 1990s. We were a hot shop at the time, and I thought we could win this recruiting battle with McKinsey, who also offered her a job. We got smoked — it wasn’t close. At one point in the wooing process, she asked to speak with other Rhodes Scholars who had succeeded at Monitor Company. Our somewhat embarrassed answer was that she would be the first. McKinsey, in stark contrast, was able to bring multiple of Directors and Principals to their Rhodes recruiting event at Oxford, sending an overpowering message to our joint candidate that the path to success at McKinsey for Rhodes Scholars was clear as a bell, while ours was murky at best.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b2bb" name="b2bb">In due course, I realized that a key part of McKinsey’s theory of advantage was to find new pools of talent first — in this case they discovered the treasure trove of consultant-ready talent at Rhodes House long before the thought occurred to us (in fact probably before we came into existence in 1983) — and ensure the talent from that pool succeeds, and then send that successful talent back to recruit in the pool in question because that makes for the most compelling pitch. If done well, competitors simply can’t catch up in signaling such a secure a road to personal success.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ffde" name="ffde">Frito Lay, WestLaw and McKinsey are good examples of theories of advantage by which competitors can’t match. The case of Olay that AG Lafley and I lay out in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Playing to Win </em>is a good example of won’t match. Recall that the turnaround strategy for Olay involved building a ‘masstige’ positioning for the brand in the mass channel (e.g., Target, Walgreens, Kroger’s) that featured many of the positive elements of the prestige channel (e.g., Nordstrom, Macy’s, Neiman Marcus). The competitor that could have readily matched our strategy was Estée Lauder, the biggest prestige player. It could have added mass channel distribution to its lowest end prestige brand, the highly successful Clinique line, and probably crushed our attempt to elevate Olay to near-prestige. But we were confident that even though Estée Lauder could have, it wouldn’t because its prestige channel partners would go ballistic, which would be too big a downside — and we were right; Estée Lauder never came.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9191" name="9191"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Capabilities: The Reality Check</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="feae" name="feae">If HTW is a theory of advantage that passes the can’t/won’t test, what items should be in the Capabilities choices box? It should include those activities in which you invest to a unique extent or in a unique way that make your theory of advantage a reality.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f826" name="f826">For Frito-Lay, it continues to invest disproportionately in information technology solutions that make each truck stop more efficient. For example, that has included generations of handheld devices that help the driver plan for each stop, organize the ordered assortment, capture the stales that need to be picked up, and generate the paperwork for the customer. More recently, it has involved developing algorithms based on sales history and store inventory to predict and generate the optimal order for each store.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dcfd" name="dcfd">For WestLaw, it is investing in a veritable army of attorneys (last time I had an inside peek, it was 1500 full time) to write up a headnote for every new case coming out of the US court system to continue to build the advantage of having the best and most intelligently searchable case database. And it is also investing disproportionately in workflow design (a capability shared across all of parent Thomson Reuters online services for professionals) to ensure that the experience of using WestLaw’s online tool is seamless as possible within the existing workflow of its legal clients.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dba2" name="dba2">For McKinsey, I have to guess a bit from the outside. But I bet it has invested heavily in the capability of building and managing the careers of its consultants. And I bet it invests disproportionately in finding and exploiting talent pools early. For example, as with its Rhodes Scholar gambit, McKinsey was early into recruiting big at INSEAD as it blossomed from an interesting European executive education center to a leading global MBA program. McKinsey is still the leader by a mile at recruiting there and undoubtedly can bring more successful McKinsey INSEAD graduates to recruiting events than can any other firm.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="84ce" name="84ce">Of course, as I have written before, organizations must create <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/the-role-of-management-systems-in-strategy-571583546fbe" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/the-role-of-management-systems-in-strategy-571583546fbe" target="_blank">Management Systems that aid in building and maintaining those distinctive Capabilities</a> that enable the theory of HTW — where organization has chosen to play, in order to meet its winning aspirations. For example, at McKinsey, its meticulously crafted exit program and its comprehensive system for keeping in touch with and supporting its alumni help it maintain its distinctive capability of building and managing the careers of its consultants which contributes to its theory of winning.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1316" name="1316"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6546" name="6546">Think of your HTW as your theory of competitive advantage. Keep working on it until it can pass the can’t/won’t test. That is, competitors can’t match your advantage, even if it would be very attractive for them to be able to do so. Or competitors won’t match your advantage because the benefit of doing so would be outweighed by detriments experienced elsewhere in their system. Remember to keep tweaking your Where-to-Play in order to create more possibilities for finding a HTW that can pass the can’t/won’t test.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="23e0" name="23e0">Think of your Capabilities as the key activities in which you must invest disproportionately and perform distinctively to underpin your theory of competitive advantage. A long list isn’t inherently superior to a short one. If the list gets beyond three-five Capabilities, it is likely that you will have listed things in which what you do is indistinguishable in effort and outcome to that of competitors. It doesn’t mean that those things aren’t important. Matching competitors on a range of activities while outperforming them on a few key Capabilities is the key to Playing to Win!</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

It is a good thing in many ways, but a dangerous one too. There are two rules by which every monopolist should abide, but few do and hence monopolies tend to end badly. I am writing my 19th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece on The Two Rules that Monopolists Ignore at their Peril, because there are strategy lessons for every business in this pattern of failure. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="90fa" name="90fa"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is a Monopoly?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8a38" name="8a38">A monopoly exists when a buyer believes there is no viable alternative to buying the offering of a single provider — and by offering, I mean the product/service at the price offered. Monopolies are more plentiful than one might think at first blush. Most companies are at least partially monopolists. For some set of their customers, there is no alternative. Their customer will only buy Tide, Guinness, Apple, or BMW. Nothing else will do. These customers would pay considerably more than the prevailing price for the privilege of consuming their sole desire.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c88a" name="c88a">However, because only a portion of these company’s customers are monopoly buyers, they don’t charge the full monopoly price because their cost structures would be untenable without the additional of non-monopoly customers, who will only buy at a more modest price. The difference between the higher price that monopoly buyers would be willing to pay and the lower price that marginal customers are willing to pay produces what economists call the ‘consumer surplus.’ The would-be monopolist’s cost structure and the lower willingness to pay are what save the entire customer base from feeling the negative effects of the existence of a monopoly.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d64b" name="d64b">But in some cases, the monopolist can acquire a volume of customers who feel that there is no alternative that is sufficient to make the economics of their business work at that scale. They are pure-play monopolies. Historically, that was Hudson’s Bay Company in beaver pelts, DeBeers in diamonds, Pan Am in US overseas flights, AT&amp;T in long distance, IBM in mainframe computers and Microsoft in PC operating systems. Did they all have 100% market share? No. But it was close enough that they could operate largely as monopolies — and extremely profitable ones.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cc9f" name="cc9f">In the proverbial good old days, it was straightforward to create a monopoly by piecing it together through acquisitions — the John D. Rockefeller way. But antitrust legislation (Sherman/Clayton) rendered that difficult. Today’s monopolies are mainly grown from the creation of a category — Amazon in online retailing, Google in search/search-based advertising, and Facebook in social media/social media-based advertising. [Of course, there is always the exception that proves the rule. With antitrust authorities utterly asleep at the switch, Luxottica has been able to acquire its way to a virtual monopoly in eyewear.]</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8ed3" name="8ed3">None of Amazon, Google, or Facebook was actually first in its field. But they did what future monopolists need to do: invest like crazy and provide a fantastic product/service experience for customers. In their early days, they were all too small to be profitable. But they invested ahead of profitability — with the gold at the end of the rainbow as a monopoly to enough customers to have very attractive profitability. That is the story of Amazon, Google and Facebook, as well as many of their predecessors.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3e56" name="3e56">That having been said, most monopolists seem bound and determined to disobey the two rules for monopolists.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5560" name="5560"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Rule #1: Be Wary of Dynamic Segmentation</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3441" name="3441">Dynamic segmentation is a concept I have always attributed to Boston Consulting Group founder and father of business strategy, the great Bruce Henderson. But I have checked with my BCG friends and apparently, he didn’t talk about it — so maybe it is something I thought up. Who knows?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f14c" name="f14c">In any event, monopolies are hugely attractive. They have routinely (as in the cases of AT&amp;T, IBM, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon) made the monopolist in question the most valuable company in the world. As a consequence, there is a huge incentive to attack the luxurious market of an existing monopolist — and innumerable companies do so. The monopolist must understand that these insurgents can’t help themselves: the opportunity is too attractive.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="851a" name="851a">But taking on the monopolist at the heart of its business is rarely their approach. The dominant approach is to chip away at the edges of the monopoly. Think of the monopolist’s business as a circular disk. At the center is the perfect customer who thinks the monopolist’s offer is perfect. As you move away from the center, the offering is ever less perfect to those customers. And that is where insurgents attack: not at the center but at the fringes. And they win fringe customers.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d220" name="d220">When MCI and Sprint attacked AT&amp;T’s monopoly, they didn’t attack the core of middle-American residential customers. They went after large businesses, who were being vastly overcharged relative to cost to serve, in order for AT&amp;T to subsidize undercharged rural customers. Facebook’s insurgents aren’t attacking the core of its business. They are picking off customers who are hyper-sensitive to privacy issues (MT Social) or hyper-sensitive to ads (MeWe) or want to get credit for their participation (Minds) or they are searching for ideas/inspiration (Pinterest). If successful, that insurgent becomes the new monopolist for that niche — some of which are too small to be profitable, others not.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bb08" name="bb08">But the result is that the original monopolist’s territory becomes ever smaller as it is dynamically segmented around the edges. Ironically, the same thing happens in due course to the new entrants’ monopolies. So, dynamically over time, markets keep segmenting and segmenting into shrinking monopolies. It is inexorable.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bd74" name="bd74">Facebook provides a good example. It continues to grow due to international expansion. But it is important to always remember per William Gibson, the future is already here, it is just not very evenly distributed. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/#1" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/#1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The future is America’s teenagers who use Facebook at a share about 20 points lower than adults. And for only 10% of them, Facebook is their preferred social media platform (compared to over 30% for Snapchat and YouTube).</a> Nothing is going to stop that train, which has already left the station, from continuing down its track.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4471" name="4471">The rule is that you have to recognize the inevitability of dynamic segmentation in your cost structure. As a monopolist, your fixed cost structure is sized to support your big disk. As the big disk gets chipped away, the business model collapses unless you manage your cost structure with the understanding that dynamic segmentation is going to happen. For IBM, going from a virtual monopoly in mainframes to competition chipping away at the edges caused its economics to collapse. The same happened to AT&amp;T in long distance, resulting in it selling to Southwest Bell Corporation (SBC) for a song.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3fa2" name="3fa2">But it is very hard to internalize this inevitability. Monopolies are so exquisitely profitable that monopolists want to spend like drunken sailors — just visit their obscenely lavish corporate headquarters — and that is because they ignore Rule #1.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="816c" name="816c"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Rule 2: Remember your job is to respect your customers</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="806a" name="806a">How does a little monopolist grow its monopoly from a tiny one to a big enough one to be economically survivable, then attractive, then a money machine? It is by delighting its customers. And it isn’t altruistic. It needs more customers to get the economic model to work. And each customer benefits from the attempt to get the next one in order to make the economics work. It is a win-win!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7191" name="7191">But then the monopolist gets to the point of making the economics work, and beyond there, the monopoly becomes a magnificent profit machine. At that point, another customer would be perfectly nice, but who really cares? The monopolist is rich beyond its wildest dreams.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f29f" name="f29f">At that point, unless the monopolist remembers Rule #2, customers go to the back of the line. They just cease to matter. In fact, they become an irritation that gets in the way of self-actualization, which is the thing that really matters to the monopolist. And then the monopolist comes up with clever ways to make more money by abusing them. Sell their data to nasty people. Force them to sign restrictive contracts. Bias search results that they used to count on for their objectivity. It goes on and on. (The analog for businesses with only a small core of monopoly customers is to take those customers completely for granted while making luxurious offers to attract new customers.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="96af" name="96af">And then the monopolist starts the slow downward spiral. It is a very slow death. Again, the future is already here; it is just not evenly distributed. Customers will appeal to the government for help (ask AT&amp;T, IBM and Microsoft). Or they will use a different device because it doesn’t use the monopoly operating system. Or they will abandon the monopolist’s service just to prove a point. In due course, the economics crater.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="526c" name="526c"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Two Rules Together</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cd7a" name="cd7a">To give an example of the two rules together, the future is already here for Facebook and the future is represented by US teens, who are demonstrating dynamic segmentation in real time and abandoning and/or deprioritizing the Facebook platform. It is because US teens are more sensitive to the kind of abuse Facebook visits on its customers than are their elders. Facebook’s economics are being supported by its international penetration. But once that curve flattens and the dynamic segmentation penetrates the whole of its business, its economics will be threatened with the kind of collapse experienced by AT&amp;T and IBM in previous eras. And Google and Amazon better watch out too. Arguably they are on the same path, just not as far along.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a01e" name="a01e"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="5b77" name="5b77">The advice is not just for pure monopolist because every business is a monopolist to some of its customers. Regardless of whether that proportion is 100% (full monopoly) or a modest fraction, it is in an unstable state that will be driven by dynamic segmentation. But your actions can either accelerate or slow its detrimental impact on the economics of your business model. Detrimental dynamic segmentation is accelerated by the natural tendency to slip into abusing your customers — because you know that they don’t believe they have an alternative. However, that abusive behavior will act as a powerful magnet for insurgents who will chip away at the edges of your monopoly and, thanks to you, will find a receptive audience. It is slowed if you take extraordinary measures to respect your customers and treat them as if they have lots of alternatives, even if they don’t. If you do respect them, you will protect your very best customers from the effects of dynamic segmentation and will be rewarded with a longer-lived and more productive monopoly.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

This one was started with a question a couple weeks ago about how planning relates to strategy, a question that I have often gotten. In the days after that question, I was shown ‘strategic plans’ from two different organizations that helped highlight the confusion and provided me the motivation to invest a PTW/PI on the question of Strategy vs. Planning: Complements not Substitutes. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="279a" name="279a">Though from contexts that couldn’t be much different, the two strategic plans were virtually identical. They specified a Vision and Mission (though interestingly, one had Vision on top of Mission and the other the opposite). Below that, each broke their organization into sensible domains — for one, it was Talent Development, Infrastructure, Brand, and Industry Evolution, for the other, it was Core Products, New Products, Infrastructure, Technology, and Scale. And then both plans laid out three or four sensible initiatives under each domain, for a total of 13–15 initiatives.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a556" name="a556">In neither case did the initiatives fail to make sense or appear counterproductive. But no matter how sensible the initiatives might be, in both cases, and for over 80% of strategic plans I am asked to assess, the set of initiatives doesn’t add up to a strategy. While they may be called strategic plans, sadly they are just plans.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="03ab" name="03ab"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is the Difference?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c669" name="c669">In short, strategy is the act of making an integrated set of choices, which positions the organization to win; while planning is the act of laying out projects with timelines, deliverables, budgets, and responsibilities.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="608b" name="608b">There are four important pieces to the definition of business strategy. First is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">choices</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">. </em>Strategy specifies the choice to do some things and not others. And that choice obeys the rule that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/is-the-opposite-of-your-choice-stupid-on-its-face-5b247ffd7f94" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/is-the-opposite-of-your-choice-stupid-on-its-face-5b247ffd7f94" target="_blank">if the opposite is stupid on its face</a>, it doesn’t count as a strategy choice. Second is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">integrated set</em></strong>. The choices must fit together and reinforce one another; they aren’t just a list. Third is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">positions</em></strong>. The choices explicitly specify a territory in which the organization will play — and will not. Fourth is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">to win</em></strong>. Strategy specifies a compelling theory for how the organization will be better than its competitors in the chosen territory.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0035" name="0035">I see planning as having five important pieces. First is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">projects</em></strong>. They are not always referred to as such but there tends to be a list of efforts to take an activity from the existing state to a preferred state — for example, to expand a plant, to reorganize the sales force, or to digitalize the payments process. Second is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">timeline</em></strong>. Each project tends to have a specified date by which it is to be completed. Third is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">deliverables</em></strong>. Each project tends to have specified deliverables that describe the preferred state. Fourth is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">budget</em></strong>. Each project tends to have resources assigned to it that are designed to enable its completion but not allow spending greater than that amount. Fifth is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">responsibilities</em></strong>. The various responsibilities associated with the project tend to be specified and doled out — for example, who is responsible for proposing decisions and who for ratifying decisions.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d6af" name="d6af">Quite simply, they are truly different. But…</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4d14" name="4d14"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How do Strategy &amp; Planning Relate to one Another?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3c74" name="3c74">In practice, I find strategy and planning to be treated as substitutes. In particular, planning is consistently utilized as a substitute for strategy. In this substitute capacity, planning is always called strategic planning because every organization knows that it needs something with ‘strategy/strategic’ in its title. Boards will insist on being presented with a strategic plan — or even better having a board/management strategy offsite! Plus, the addition of the adjective ‘strategic’ to any business noun makes it seem cool and important.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6aa3" name="6aa3">But strategy is less understood and has greater downsides than planning. For most, the definition of strategy is the above paragraph on planning. And if you present a strategic plan to the board and faithfully complete all the projects in the strategic plan, it isn’t management’s fault that the result was terrible. In fact, the situation in which all the projects in the plan are completed on schedule and on budget but the financials of the organization go to hell in a hand basket tends to be accompanied by management requests for full bonuses for having completed all the projects. If instead, management presents an explicit strategy and it fails, it is hard to hide behind anything. So, the rule is don’t do, strategy: plan.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b0b9" name="b0b9">Instead of substitutes, strategy and planning should be complements.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="71d2" name="71d2">The choices of a strategy typically create projects unless the strategy specifies doing the same things the same way. While on occasion that is the choice, in most cases strategy choice involves building capabilities that are needed to win to a greater extent in the current or a new place to play. Some of those capabilities may not currently exist in the organization or, at a minimum, aren’t good enough. That makes it necessary to specify the projects, including timeline, deliverables, budget, and responsibilities for each such project.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d67a" name="d67a">Thus, there is no conflict between strategy and planning. Effective strategy needs thorough planning. And planning is of limited value without strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a19a" name="a19a">That having been said, I have a somewhat different view of the planning that arises out of strategy than most. Rather than being dramatically different than the strategy work that proceeded it, I believe the decision-making involved in the projects flowing out of strategy is more similar to than different from strategy. To me, each project actually requires another round of determining an integrated set of choices that positions the organization to win in respect of that project. And when that set of choices for that particular project is made, it will beget another set of projects that need this sort of planning, and so on. It is, as the elderly lady is reputed to have said to William James: it is turtles all the way down!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4463" name="4463">So, they are complements to toggle between. Make choices, specify projects that must be planned, which involve more choices, which beget projects and so on back and forth.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f928" name="f928"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9477" name="9477">I divide my practitioner insights into advice for reviewers versus producers of strategic plans.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fb03" name="fb03">If you are in a position of reviewing a strategic plan, don’t be lulled or cowed into accepting a plan as strategy. You will be presented frequently with plans masquerading as a strategy, so it is an ever-present danger. The problem with plans is that they require massive amounts of investment and work — and often for very little reward. While competitors are unhampered in playing to win, your organization will be doing stuff — typically lots and lots of stuff. Instead insist on a strategy with an integrated set of choices that positions to win. It must provide a clear theory of advantage. If not it is a plan and nothing more. And on any project on which you approve the spending of time and money, make certain that contributes directly to the realization of that theory of advantage.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="1bb3" name="1bb3">If you are in a position of producing a strategic plan, don’t forget that the reward to playing is consistently low. It doesn’t matter that your organization is working non-stop on a bunch of projects that the plan has laid out. While it may feel somewhat intimidating to come up with a clear theory of advantage that involves making real choices that are different from those of competitors, your reward is that having that clear strategy makes everything else easier. It is clearer which projects are essential and which are nice-to-have. The deliverables on each project are clearer. And the work will be more fulfilling because it will give you a chance of winning, not just playing.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Martin, 2021</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="7b11" name="7b11">I get many questions about where purpose, vision, mission, and goals fit in the Strategic Choice Cascade, because its five boxes don’t include any of those terms. So, I decided to address that set of related questions in this Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece, my 21st in the series. I will begin with purpose, vision, mission, and winning aspiration and then address the question of goals. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="96e4" name="96e4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Winning Aspiration</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a0b5" name="a0b5">In strategy formulation, it is common to see an organization create statements for each of purpose, vision, and mission, or at least two of the three. While I don’t object to an organization having two or three of these statements, in my decades of work on strategy I honestly have not seen any positive value in having multiple such statements. In fact, there doesn’t seem to be any consistent or common definition of the terms. For example, sometimes the vision is subordinate to mission and other times it is the opposite. And when there is an attempt to parse out into three separate statements what the organization is attempting to do, it strikes me as getting close to the how-many-angels-can-dance-on-the-head-of-a-pin territory.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d0f1" name="d0f1">I prefer to keep strategy as simple as possible, so I have a single box at the top of the cascade: winning aspiration. I use aspiration because I like the word: “a strong desire to achieve something high or great” according to Merriam Webster, or “steadfast desire or longing for something above one” according to the Oxford English Dictionary. That is the meaning I want: strong desire combined with high goal. But if others want to substitute purpose, vision, or mission for the word aspiration, I am totally fine with it. I just care about the content of that first box on the cascade.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5017" name="5017">To me, the key is that it should specify that the organization seeks to add value to customers in a sufficiently unique manner that it will do so better than anybody. That is why I like aspirations such as the following:</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="917d" name="917d">Starbucks: “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Establish Starbucks as the premier purveyor of the finest coffee in the world</em>”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7f49" name="7f49">Asos: “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">To become the number 1 fashion destination for 20-somethings globally</em>”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="38cd" name="38cd">Apple: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“</strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">To make the best products on earth, and to leave the world better than we found it</em>”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="024b" name="024b">I like PayPal’s old one (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">To build the Web’s most convenient, secure, cost-effective payment solution</em>) better than its new one (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">To reimagine money, to democratize financial services, so that managing and moving money is a right for all citizens, not just the affluent</em>). The former seeks to be the best, while the latter seeks to do something interesting.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="60d7" name="60d7">Motivation is key to an aspiration. To be effective, an aspiration needs to be motivational to employees and customers. It should make employees want to come to work excited by the prospect of achieving the stated aspiration and it should contribute to convincing customers that the company is focused on their welfare. For example, if P&amp;G’s aspiration was only its vision (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Be, and be recognized as, the best consumer products and services company in the world</em>), I wouldn’t give it a great grade. But when combined with its mission (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">We will provide branded products and services of superior quality and value that improve the lives of the world’s consumers, now and for generations to come</em>), it makes a great aspiration. Be the best, on behalf of the world’s consumers, not just one of “be the best” or “improve the lives of the world’s consumers.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="86f7" name="86f7">It is a mistake to have any mention of shareholder value in a winning aspiration. Consider this one: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">FedEx Corporation will produce superior financial returns for its shareowners by providing high value-added logistics, transportation and related business services through focused operating companies.</em> The customer’s only role is as a generator of value for shareholders, which is hardly motivational for them. It would demotivate me as a customer. And it is really hard for me to imagine myself as an employee leaping out of bed in the morning to work toward achieving this aspiration. FedEx is a great company with an underwhelming mission statement.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e095" name="e095"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Role of Goals in Winning Aspiration</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="551d" name="551d">For me, the other key component of the winning aspiration box is the specification of goals that will help assess progress toward achieving the aspiration. It is very unlikely that an organization will achieve its aspiration unless it can measure progress toward it in some way. An organization needs to know whether it is headed in the right direction and on track to achieve the aspiration so that it knows whether to stay the course or to make a course correction.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3384" name="3384">If we take the Starbucks statement (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Establish Starbucks as the premier purveyor of the finest coffee in the world</em>), we would need to have a definition of “premier” and “finest” to be able to convert the statement into a set of timebound goals against which we could measure progress. Does premier mean biggest, or best customer ratings, or highest sales/sq ft? Does finest mean blind taste test wins, or highest quality inputs, or #1 in third-party rankings? For Asos (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">To become the number 1 fashion destination for 20-somethings globally</em>), does number 1 fashion destination mean most visited site or most ecommerce transaction volume or most highly ranked by third parties? Even 20-somethings needs a definition.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a263" name="a263">Only if an organization defines the key terms clearly enough to set measurable, timebound goals will the winning aspiration be effective in guiding the organization forward. If an organization can’t define the terms well enough to set goals, it is clear evidence that it needs to revisit its winning aspiration.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0a2f" name="0a2f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Goals and Management Systems</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c8a9" name="c8a9">As I have written about previously in <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/the-role-of-management-systems-in-strategy-571583546fbe" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/the-role-of-management-systems-in-strategy-571583546fbe" target="_blank">The Role of Management Systems in Strategy</a>, one category of features to be included in management systems is non-standard measurement/tracking of information. That is to say, if the other choices of strategy (winning aspiration, where-to-play, how-to-win, capabilities) necessitate an unusual measurement/tracking system, then it is an important choice in management systems to develop such a measurement/tracking system. If it is just standard stuff that is already tracked in the ERM system or as a matter of course, it isn’t a distinctive choice, and you should measure/track like everyone else. But if it is integral to a choice to be different than competitors, then it needs to be incorporated into management systems.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="17f3" name="17f3">Leading packaging company WestRock’s winning aspiration is to be <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the premier partner and unrivaled provider of sustainable winning packaging solutions for its customers</em>. In order to judge whether it is doing so, or not, WestRock needed to create a<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong>distinctive management system for measuring whether it is helping a given customer accomplish one of the following four value-adding outcomes:<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong>lower their total costs, grow their sales, reduce their risk, and/or improve their sustainability.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="21dc" name="21dc"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7e85" name="7e85">When it comes to the tangled mess of purpose, vision, mission, and aspirations, keep it simple. You only need one. It doesn’t really matter what you call it but stick to a single one. And make sure that it focuses on winning with customers in a way that is motivational to both employees and customers. If your aspiration does not involve winning, somebody else in your space will have a winning aspiration and they are likely to leave you behind in the dust.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="de0e" name="de0e">Translate your winning aspiration into measurable, time-bound goals that help you keep on the path to achievement of your aspiration. If it is really hard to come up with goals of this sort, it is likely because your winning aspiration is probably too vague and abstract. It is a signal that it is time to revisit your winning aspiration.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="7622" name="7622">Finally, recognize that some strategies require the building of a new management system to measure progress on the key goals. That is not a bad thing — it is a positive sign of the distinctiveness of your strategy.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Martin, 2021</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="c2e6" name="c2e6">I had a conversation on effectiveness with friend Zachary First, Executive Director of the Drucker Center and based on the discussion, I thought a Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) on The Role of Strategy in Achieving Managerial Effectiveness would be in order as PTW/PI #23. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9081" name="9081"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Drucker on Effectiveness</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="63f6" name="63f6">Peter Drucker was, of course, the prophet of effectiveness. His 1966 classic, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Peter-Drucker/dp/1138470104" href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Peter-Drucker/dp/1138470104" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Effective Executive</a>, is still the best book ever written on managerial effectiveness. Three years earlier, he wrote what might be thought of as a teaser for the book in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Harvard Business Review</em>, an article entitled, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/1963/05/managing-for-business-effectiveness" href="https://hbr.org/1963/05/managing-for-business-effectiveness" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Managing for Business Effectiveness</a>, which provides a quick and enjoyable summary of his views on effectiveness if you don’t want to read the whole book.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9c2f" name="9c2f">To Drucker, the core of effectiveness was the direction of resources and efforts toward “economically significant results.” On that front, he wasn’t very sanguine about the existing state of play, estimating that “while 90% of the results are being produced by the first 10% of events, 90% of the costs are being increased by the remaining and result-less 90% of events.” Further, “I have yet to see an executive, regardless of rank or station, who could not consign something like a quarter of the demands on his time to the wastepaper basket without anybody’s noticing their disappearance.” He predicted that without dedicated attention to effectiveness, executive efforts will “drift into nothing-producing activities.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8f6c" name="8f6c">I think Drucker was ahead of his time (as was typically the case with his work) in thinking about the true work of a manager. To him, their key work product was choices (and I concur which is why I refer to today’s office towers as <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2013/10/rethinking-the-decision-factory" href="https://hbr.org/2013/10/rethinking-the-decision-factory" rel="noopener" target="_blank">decision factories</a>):“The end products of the manager’s work are decisions and actions, rather than knowledge and insight.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6f19" name="6f19"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How to Make Effective Choices</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="aca0" name="aca0">If choice that drives toward economically significant results is the measure of managerial effectiveness, how can an executive be effective in focusing effort on and making such choices? The only way I have observed is through strategy. Now I know there will be those who will ask: “But Drucker said <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">culture eats strategy for breakfast</em>, so how can you quote Drucker on effectiveness and say strategy is key?” The quote’s fame notwithstanding, Drucker Center archivists have looked long and hard for evidence that Drucker either wrote or spoke those words and they found zero such evidence. I will proceed undaunted!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a7d4" name="a7d4">Strategy is critically important because without a strategy, you can’t discern the difference between a good choice, a mediocre choice, and a terrible choice. There are so many times, after a decision shows itself to have produced a dreadful outcome, that I hear the question: “what were those morons thinking?” But in all such cases, my assessment has been that the people making the choices weren’t morons. They were conscientious and intelligent. But they weren’t guided by a sound strategy which would have enabled them to discern between good, mediocre and terrible choice. Instead, they chose something that seemed sensible but was not.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4e27" name="4e27">Ford Motor Company’s relaunch of the Lincoln Continental in 2016 was an abysmal failure during its five-year run. But I don’t think the designers of the vehicle were morons, or the engineers, or the marketers. There simply was not a coherent strategy for the Lincoln business at Ford to guide the executives making the decisions on both the choice to relaunch and all the subsequent choices that shaped the vehicle and its positioning in the market. There was no theory as to why adding a third sedan to the Lincoln lineup at a time that buyers were shifting decisively to SUVs made sense, nor any reason to believe that a single new Lincoln sedan would compete successfully against luxury competitors such as BMW and Mercedes with over a dozen sedans in each of their stables.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4232" name="4232">In the context of this strategic vacuum, it seemed like a good idea at the time to bring back a venerable nameplate as the flagship sedan in the Lincoln line-up. However, only 7,500 American car buyers/year agreed, which made for a failure, placing all the Lincoln Continental efforts in Drucker’s result-less/nothing-producing category.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="81eb" name="81eb">What can strategy do to reduce result-less/nothing-producing choices? One, a clear Winning Aspiration will tell you what winning looks like, so you will have a better chance of making choices that are consistent with that aspiration, as well as measure progress toward it. Two, a clear Where-to-Play tells you where should be playing and where not — helping you avoid making choices to spend resources outside your defined Where-to-Play. Three, a matched How-to-Win choice provides your theory of winning, which enables you to focus your efforts and make subsequent choices that are consistent with that theory of winning. Four, a clear definition of Capabilities helps focus investment choices on those capabilities that are essential to winning. Five, a clear enumeration of the Management Systems necessary to build and maintain the target Capabilities will similarly help focus investment choices in building the systems that really matter.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="113f" name="113f">In these five ways, your strategy should narrow your focus onto the 10% of efforts that produce the 90% of results and help you avoid the 90% of efforts that produce 10% of the results, thus enhancing your managerial effectiveness. If a strategy doesn’t focus and help your daily choice making, then it simply isn’t a sufficiently useful strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="db5b" name="db5b"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Two Strategy Drawbacks that Impede Managerial Effectiveness</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b158" name="b158">I observe two drawbacks to strategy that make it unhelpful for managerial effectiveness: strategy that is abstract, and strategy that is implicit.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f4de" name="f4de">Many strategies are stated at an unhelpfully high level of abstraction. “Our strategy is to be customer centric.” “Our strategy is to be the innovation leader.” Those are such general statements of strategy that they provide little guidance to the choices an executive might make to further that strategy. Almost any decision or expenditure of resources could be made to fit at that level of generality. If your strategy doesn’t help you say ‘no’ at least occasionally, you will be in the result-less/nothing-producing territory in no time.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a049" name="a049">The other challenge arises when strategy is implicit. As I have argued before in this series, everybody has a strategy because <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://roger-78069.medium.com/strategy-is-what-you-do-not-what-you-say-a6e483840557" href="https://roger-78069.medium.com/strategy-is-what-you-do-not-what-you-say-a6e483840557" rel="noopener" target="_blank">strategy is what you do, not what you say</a>. However, an implicit strategy creates two difficulties. First, it is hard for those around you to figure out your strategy if you leave it implicit and their confusion will lead them to engage in result-less/nothing-producing activities as they attempt to guess at the specifics of the strategy in your head. Second, while you might be in a better position than those around you because at least the strategy is floating around in your head, it is much easier for you to rationalize any choice as fitting with your strategy when you haven’t taken the time to make it explicit by writing it down. Writing is thinking and your strategy will be fuzzier and more abstract if you fail to commit it to paper. A classic reason for a strategy to only exist in your head is that you never invested as much thinking in it as you should have.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c781" name="c781"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="78e4" name="78e4">As with most of his assertions, Drucker is right in arguing that achieving effectiveness is an enduring management challenge. Eternal vigilance is required to avoid the trap of wasting your time on result-less/nothing-producing activities. To avoid the trap, ask yourself whether each choice you make is guided by a principle in your strategy? Reflect on whether you have said ‘no’ to activities or choices based on your strategy. If it is hard to link choices to your strategy or to say ‘no’ based on your strategy, take that as a signal that you need to make your strategy more concrete. Only if it helps you be more effective on a daily basis, to be more discerning in your choices, is your strategy sufficiently concrete for you to be an effective executive.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Martin, 2021</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="5698" name="5698">In the development of strategy, there is a hidden tension between two largely implicit forces that must be balanced productively to produce strategy that helps your organization persist. To provide guidance on that delicate balance, I decided to make the 24th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights piece on Reliability versus Validity in Strategy. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="df21" name="df21"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Fundamental Tension</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ca11" name="ca11">When people work together to make decisions and solve problems, there is a hidden tension between two opposing forces that influence from the background. One force is reliability, which is the desire for a dependable, consistent, and replicable outcome. The Stanford-Binet IQ (SBIQ) test exemplifies reliability. If you take it numerous times from childhood to adulthood, you will produce a nearly identical score each time, a feature that has made it the dominant IQ test in the world. The other force is validity, which is the desire for an outcome that meets the desired objective.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e043" name="e043">Most people would not view the desired objective of an IQ test to be only the generation of a consistent number that we can assign as your intelligence. Instead, they would want the test to tell you something about your future prospects owing to the measure of your intelligence. It turns out that SBIQ does a pretty dreadful job of that. Only 30% of anything you accomplish in the rest of your life can be correlated with your SBIQ score. Hence while it is highly reliable, it has poor validity. Daniel Goleman famously provided an alternative, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Intelligence-10th-Anniversary-Matter/dp/055380491X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=" href="https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Intelligence-10th-Anniversary-Matter/dp/055380491X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=" rel="noopener" target="_blank">emotional intelligence</a>, or EQ, which he argues correlates much better with future outcomes. However, EQ measurement hasn’t displaced IQ measurement, in large part because EQ measurement is not as reliable as IQ measurement.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3b51" name="3b51">Reliability and validity are produced by very different ways of thinking.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="b21d" name="b21d"><img class="graf-image" data-height="480" data-image-id="1*5fOPNwnGF0G_jX8CuSdsUQ.gif" data-width="853" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5fOPNwnGF0G_jX8CuSdsUQ.gif"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin, 2021</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="de48" name="de48">Reliability is generated by only considering variables that are objectively quantifiable without judgment — so that there is no bias involved. That is why SBIQ defines intelligence as one’s ability to solve little logical puzzles for which there is one objectively correct answer, which helps generate its impressive test-retest reliability. However, success in life requires more than solving little logical puzzles. And that is why Goleman includes one’s ability to interact successfully with others and demonstrate empathy in doing so as part of his EQ evaluation procedure. He broadens the number of variables he utilizes to include those that require judgment to assess and with judgment comes the potential for bias. In this way, the features that drive more reliability drive less validity and vice versa, hence the degree to which the tension is fundamental.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c3ea" name="c3ea">These contrasting thinking approaches play out in business on a daily basis. Think of the classic approaches of General Electric versus Apple. At GE, the numbers ruled. Businesses were cost-reduced year after year to eke out more profits. Six Sigma black belts roamed the company optimizing the here and now. For decades, GE produced consistent, replicable, reliable outcomes, hitting its quarterly guidance to the penny. Meanwhile, at Apple Steve Jobs focused on outcomes that he desperately wanted to generate: an exquisite user experience, devotion from his users, to dent the universe. The former obeyed the principles of reliability; the latter those of validity.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e78e" name="e78e"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Tension at Play in Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c346" name="c346">This tension plays out in the development of strategy. When those involved push for strategy based on the objective analysis of past quantitative data, whether they know it or not, they are pushing for a reliable outcome, as did successive CEOs at GE. When others may push to imagine future possibilities and consider attributes of the decision that can’t be quantified and that require judgment, they are pushing for a valid outcome, as did Jobs at Apple.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1cc9" name="1cc9">Within a given corporation, these camps tend to argue back and forth without knowing the true roots of their disagreement. The reliability-focused strategists think their validity-focused colleagues are being dangerously cavalier. The validity-focused strategists think that their reliability-focused colleagues are narrowminded and miss the bigger picture.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="acb6" name="acb6"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Limits to Reliability</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f05e" name="f05e">The tricky thing about reliability is that it is reliable until it isn’t. The pursuit of consistent replicable outcomes does not guarantee the production thereof. If you base your decisions on the objective crunching of past data, you will produce reliable results only as long as the context stays fixed and doesn’t change in any meaningful way. For example, if for the past six quarters, we have been able to increase earnings by cutting product costs each quarter, our reliability-driven analysis may suggest that another round of product cost reduction will produce another quarterly earnings increase. But that may be the straw that breaks the camel’s back: the reduction in product quality that creates a broadscale customer revolt or spurs competitive entry under the price umbrella we have set. If either is the case, a reliability-driven approach will fail to produce a reliable result.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8022" name="8022">At GE, the reliability driven management approach eventually hit the wall. It took a long time for it to do so, but as is often the case, when it crashed, it crashed precipitously, and GE may never recover.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="69cc" name="69cc"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Limits of Validity</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="64e7" name="64e7">That having been said, the opposite is not a panacea. An entirely validity-driven approach will embrace the extremes of uncertainty and not take advantage of the data that can be accessed and used. It is arguable that Jobs was unceremoniously fired from his own company because in his first stint as CEO he was unbalanced in favor of validity. He believed that he would be substantiated by future events and arguably paid little attention to the warnings of those concerned about at least a base level of reliability — financial planning, supply chain management, etc. The extreme attention to validity without reliability balance took Apple to the brink of insolvency.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="63ee" name="63ee">I would argue that when Jobs was rehired, he came back to Apple as a leader who demonstrated more balance between validity and reliability. He still showed the same dedication to creating a future that did not then exist. But he paid more attention to robust supply chains, operational thoroughness, and financial planning than in his first stint as CEO. And it was in this more balanced era that he created the vast majority of Apple’s value.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="31f6" name="31f6"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Implications for Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d5c3" name="d5c3">The key is to drive for balance between reliability and validity in the development of strategy. It is the only way that an organization can ensure persistence. Too much reliability and it grinds to a halt. Too much validity and it goes off the rails. Balance means crunching the data that you can gather on the variables that lend themselves to objective quantification. But it also means considering variables that can’t be quantified, objectively or otherwise, and applying your judgment to them. It means avoiding bias to the extent possible but recognizing that the possibility of bias cannot be allowed to paralyze you.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ef93" name="ef93">While danger lurks on either side of the divide, I find that more often reliability dominates validity in strategy development in the modern large corporation. Ironically, the initial strategies of entrepreneurial enterprises tend to be highly validity oriented. An entrepreneur believes in a future that will be different — and better — than the past, often based on judgment, not objective measures, and then sets out to make that vision come true. If it does come true, the enterprise prospers, often goes public, and acquires a board of directors. As it gets bigger and more formally managed, there tends to be more calls for reliability — for meeting quarterly earnings targets reliably, for formal approval of projects based on financial projections, etc. Validity oriented thinking, which got the business started, gets increasingly discouraged or suppressed entirely.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fe59" name="fe59">Because the world has a nasty habit of shifting, changing, and adjusting, a heavy bias toward reliability in development of strategy will leave the corporation vulnerable. The changing context will make the reliability-driven strategy a bad match for the future. But the confidence that comes from all that objective analysis will typically cause the corporation to be slow to recognize that its strategy is flawed and make productive changes. Meanwhile, competitors will have an open field for creating the future.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c822" name="c822"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8214" name="8214">Reliability and validity are the hidden forces that shape the way we think and decide. Everyone has their own comfort zone, whether more reliability-oriented or more validity-oriented. Recognize your own predilection. If you are reliability-oriented, be extra careful not to dismiss your validity-oriented colleagues. They aren’t dangerous; they can help you strive for better outcomes. If you are validity-oriented, don’t dismiss your reliability-oriented colleagues. They aren’t dull and boring; they can protect your flank.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="07f2" name="07f2">Throughout the process of creating strategy, keep asking yourself whether you are considering both reliability and validity in your thinking. Pull out the chart above and check whether your thinking draws from both columns or just one. If it is just one, find a colleague who can help stretch your thinking to incorporate the other column. It will help you generate a more robust strategy and enable your organization to persist.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

I get the question sufficiently often that I decided to do my 25th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) on Where’s the Business Model in Playing to Win? (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d7de" name="d7de"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Business Model</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="620f" name="620f">Business model takes on a mythical aura for many. When entrepreneurs get asked about their business model, the desired response is something that will make it clear it is headed for the stars. It is going to be the Airbnb of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">x</em> or the Warby Parker of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">y</em>. Our ‘business model’ is that we’ll charge $1.50/order to the shoe company to which we send a shoe-buyer that comes to our shoe-buying aggregation site. And with only 700,000 pairs, we will be at over $1 million in revenue. The sky is the limit!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9bd4" name="9bd4">The business model is important indeed. Somebody must pay you an amount to cover your costs and, over and above that, earn a profit. So, you do need a revenue model and a cost model — preferably ones that fit together. In a world in which the numbers are often viewed as sacrosanct, the above business model would do for most.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="28c2" name="28c2"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Model Anchored in Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="60a0" name="60a0">But my view is that you can always make up any numbers you want — and in fact all revenue forecasts are exercises in fantasy. Is $1.50/pair acceptable? Are there 700,000 users? Saying that those are the numbers doesn’t make them real — especially when it is someone else’s decision to spend/pay. So, I want the business model to be anchored in and arise out of the core features of strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cb92" name="cb92">Because the Where-to-Play/How-to-Win (WTP/HTW) pair of choices is the heart of strategy, the business model needs to be embedded in and arise out of that choice pair. The WTP has to specify from what customers you are going to receive revenues. That is central to your business model. And it is not always straightforward in the modern economy. There are many two-sided markets where there is a ‘money side’ (e.g., advertisers who pay for Google words) and a ‘subsidy side’ (e.g., searchers who don’t pay). Congressional committees may imagine that Google and Facebook are ‘free services’ because Congress doesn’t understand two-sided market business models.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="93ef" name="93ef">The HTW choice needs to explain how it is you will earn a better margin serving the customers specified in the WTP than your competitors. That can be accomplished either by selling at an average price combined with lower costs or by selling at a higher price combined with average costs. Your HTW has to specify a theory as to why it is, in the WTP specified, you will be able either to earn higher prices or to serve customers at a lower cost structure. That theory needs to specify both how you will get to that position and how you will maintain it. Otherwise, you don’t have a business model actually worth having. You can certainly lay it out in a spreadsheet, but it won’t be around for long and it certainly won’t look like your spreadsheet. That is because someone else will have advantage over you and will slowly but surely crush your business.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7934" name="7934">In this way, your business model arises out of your WTP/HTW choice. The WTP tells you from which customers you will be garnering revenues and the HTW tells you the level of revenues you can expect and the costs you need to spend to earn those revenues.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7027" name="7027">The reality check for strategy is the Capabilities and Management Systems (MS) choices that determine whether you can build and maintain the Capabilities that are necessary to win where you have chosen to play. The business model needs to incorporate the costs of building and maintaining these Capabilities. If your HTW requires that you are better at branding to be able to sustain premium pricing, then what resources do you need to spend in advertising on an ongoing basis? With those advertising costs, will you still maintain overall cost proximity. If your HTW requires that you have an advantaged cost position based on scale, does your scale give you the cost economies that you need? If your system requires better quality human resources, does your recruitment system cost too much? These are the kind of reality checks your business model needs to pass — or it will be just like most business models: a fantasy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fb3e" name="fb3e">In the modern economy, there is an important role for your Winning Aspiration (WA) in determining the robustness of your business model. In most industries today, fixed costs have taken over the biggest proportion of the overall cost structure. A hundred years ago, the cost structures of most companies were weighted towards the variable costs associated with producing another unit of the product (or service). For example, building an automobile required lots of raw materials/parts and high variable labor costs, with a modest overlay of fixed costs. Now the biggest portion of the cost structure of most modern companies is in fixed costs like R&amp;D, advertising, engineering, managerial overhead, distribution system, IT, etc. The variable costs associated with another unit are often negligible. What is the cost of serving another Facebook user? Close to zero. What is the cost of providing another copy of Office 365? Close to zero. Even a classic product company like P&amp;G has greater fixed costs than variable costs today.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ae59" name="ae59">With such a cost structure, relative scale is essential to the robustness of the strategy and of the business model. In the context of any defined WTP, the player with the greatest scale will have the most attractive economics because it can spread its fixed costs more broadly than its smaller competitors. As a consequence, it will either be able to spend more in order to differentiate or achieve parity with a lower overall cost structure. For example, if it has a relative market share higher than anyone else, every dollar it spends on advertising will cost it less per unit sold than for any competitor. If instead, a competitor is bigger than you in a given WTP, its economics will be superior and that will play out with it getting relatively stronger over time and while you become relatively weaker.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1ad4" name="1ad4">In this way, each box in the Strategy Choice Cascade both defines and validates your business model. In order to have a business model that works, you need a Winning Aspiration that drives you to achieve the largest position in the chosen Where-to-Play, which has to be twinned with a How-to-Win, which generates the advantage that enables the achievement of the dominant share. And that WTP/HTW choice needs to be supported by Capabilities and Management Systems that can be built and maintained to consistently deliver the form of winning assumed in the WTP/HTW choice. If these choices are sharply made and mutually reinforcing, they will generate a business model that is a reality, not a fantasy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2ae1" name="2ae1"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="c569" name="c569">When you are asked about your business model, don’t think of it as something independent of your strategy. Start with your strategy — your Winning Aspiration, your Where-to-Play, your How-to-Win, your Capabilities, and your Management System. That will provide a more compelling rationale for why revenues will flow to you and profits over costs will accrue. If they are impatient and just want to know the numbers, you are wasting your time with them. There is no business model without a strategy. And all great strategies, generate a business model that is attractive and persistent.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

However, the transformation is deadly to most players that are there at its start. To help those players, I decided to write my 26th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece on The Shift from Pre-Competitive to Competitive. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e8bd" name="e8bd"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is Pre-Competitive?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3feb" name="3feb">In pre-competitive industries, many competitors typically co-exist in relatively happy state. While they compete for business, when they lose a piece of business, it isn’t a terribly big deal. Although not pleasant, losing a piece of business doesn’t alter the competitive dynamics. There is always other business to win.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="19c0" name="19c0">This sort of pre-competitive state would describe garbage collection before Waste Management Inc (WMI). There were thousands of small garbage collectors across the country. They may have competed for business at the edge of their territory, but it wasn’t all or nothing competition (except maybe in New Jersey!). The same held for video rental stores before Blockbuster.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f0db" name="f0db">In the mid-1980s, my industry, strategy consulting, was pre-competitive. In addition to the largest competitors of the day, McKinsey, BCG and Bain, there were innumerable smaller firms competing, including my firm, Monitor, but also Corporate Decisions, Strategic Planning Associates, Oliver Wyman, Marakon, Parthenon, etc. It felt like in our office building off Harvard Square alone, there were a half-dozen strategy boutiques.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ad88" name="ad88">There are still lots of precompetitive industries today. The corporate legal services market in NYC today is pre-competitive. There are still a bunch of white shoe law firms in NYC, all of which feature partners who make lots of money doing their own practice. They compete, but not to the death — because each of them is relatively satisfied with their existing business model and their slice of the big, profitable pie.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4cf1" name="4cf1">It is not just smaller industries. The automotive industry is only now moving out of its pre-competitive stage. Since its inception, there have been scores of competitors around the world. Until recently, the biggest global market share stood at barely over 10%. Even now with a global consolidation underway, it is only 13% for co-leaders Toyota and Volkswagen.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e90f" name="e90f">All of the participants in garbage collection, video rentals, and strategy consulting in the 1980/1990s, automotive in the past decade, and corporate legal services today would claim that they are in competitive industries. They are and they aren’t. They compete, but gently — not as if survival is at stake.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="67b3" name="67b3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Going Competitive</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="754e" name="754e">But survival will be at stake because someday, some player — either from inside or as a new entrant — takes an action that precipitates a transformation, one that rarely stops after it gets started. The action is to push a scale button in a way that makes remaining a small player nearly or entirely impossible.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fc16" name="fc16">When Wayne Huizenga of WMI started buying up clusters of small garbage collectors, building centralized repair depots, and getting sizable volume discounts on his trucks, he changed the competitive dynamics. Scale provided such dramatic advantages that WMI just kept getting bigger and at the same time competitively stronger until such time that most of the little players were wiped out of the industry — and now WMI, Republic and Stericycle duke it out in a competitive market. And in general, WMI makes lots of profit, Republic decent profit, and Stericycle little or none.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="eea5" name="eea5">It happened in strategy consulting, initially driven by McKinsey. I remember being co-head of Monitor in the mid-1990s when McKinsey announced that it would spend annually on R&amp;D/product development an amount that happened to be equal to our total revenues. I knew that wouldn’t be good! The ante got upped with free work to get a client started. It used to be that you sold them a study to figure out the answer. Then it became that you gave them the answer free up front to win the relationship. Then you built a low-cost analytical capacity in India. And a Global Institute to build new IP. All of these competitive weapons required scale that made it relatively easy for McKinsey, harder for BCG, harder still for Bain and impossible for Monitor-sized competitors. This was clearly an exercise in pushing the scale button in strategy consulting.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a68d" name="a68d">Now the industry is dominated by the consulting giants, McKinsey, BCG and Bain, plus the huge broad-based professional service firms, Deloitte (which absorbed Monitor), EY (Parthenon) and PWC (Booz). The few mid-sized players left (OC&amp;C, SDG, LEK, Mitchell Madison, Roland Berger) exist on the fringes of a competitive industry with an independent future in doubt because the big players have pushed the scale button and the little guys just can’t keep up.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bb53" name="bb53">It is finally happening in the automotive industry, driven by the massive investments needed to participate in the transition first to electric vehicles (EV) and then to autonomous vehicles (AV). Tesla has demonstrated that you either make gigantic investments in EV or you don’t get to play at all. And Google is attempting to prove the same thing in AV with its Waymo venture. It spent countless billions of its own capital before getting outside investors to pump another $2.25 billion into a venture for which returns aren’t remotely close to being realized. The merger of Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and Peugeot (PSA) is their way of responding to a competitive environment that will require mountains of investment dollars.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d76c" name="d76c">The feature that defines a market as competitive is that losing a piece of business means that you are making yourself competitively weaker and the competitor to whom you lost the business competitively stronger. While corporate legal services in NYC is pre-competitive, I would argue that the proxy solicitation segment of the business is competitive. The narrower territory pits the competitors more clearly against one another. There, a smaller set of specialist duke it out, including recognized leaders such as MacKenzie, Innisfree and D.F. King. When one loses an assignment as the solicitor for a high-profile proxy battle, it gives the winner a reputation boost and the added experience necessary to make the next beauty-contest easier for it to win and harder for the loser. A string of losses in a row can result in a fall from which recovery is challenging. They need to compete as if survival is at stake.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="98b9" name="98b9">Sometimes the shift to competitive can happen very quickly. When Canadian regulations changed to enable the large life insurance companies to demutualize, I strongly encouraged my law firm client to compete super-aggressively on the very first big one and have one of the firm’s top partners lead the file. They wondered why I was so adamant because traditionally providing legal services to Canadian insurance companies was not a big deal because they were sleepy mutual companies that required routine legal services, much of which the insurance companies did internally. But my client listened, won the business, and based on that initial experience, built up the proprietary know-how that enabled the firm to dominate the transformation of the Canadian life insurance industry to public companies. In this case, the insurance industry legal services market went from pre-competitive to competitive in one fell swoop.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cc55" name="cc55"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="15cf" name="15cf">The most important practitioner insight is to not assume that the level of competitiveness in your industry is natural — the way it should be — or stable — the way it will continue to be. It can change precipitously. The rules of competition change quickly, and it doesn’t take long for the consequences to become inevitable.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="241e" name="241e">The flow is one way. When it goes competitive, it will be irreversible. I have never seen a competitive industry return to pre-competitive state. It may happen someday, but I am not holding my breath.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f003" name="f003">There are defensive and offensive implications of the specter of the shift from pre-competitive to competitive.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0a2c" name="0a2c">On the defensive side, it is critical to be extremely wary of and attentive to a competitor — existing or new to the space — pushing a scale button in your industry. Bricks and mortar MBA programs had to recognize early that on-line players had a model in which increasing scale increases cost effectiveness rather than their traditional model that featured limited benefits to scale. Already the biggest on-line players are multiples of the size of the biggest MBA programs and many traditional MBA programs are shuttering — and it is just the start of that transformation. It is a tricky decision whether to follow as soon as the transformation starts. But if you don’t do so immediately, it becomes too late very quickly. My prediction is that by 2030 there will be fewer than 50% of the US MBA programs that existed in 2015.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="61d2" name="61d2">On the offensive side, it is always worthwhile to contemplate ways in which you can push the scale button before anyone else. If it can be done, it will be done by somebody. If someone can build a more scalable classified advertising platform than your newspaper, they will build it eventually. And when they do, your business won’t suffer: it will implode. Long before online travel intermediaries began to aggregate customer demand and interpose themselves between customers and airlines, Southwest Airlines recognized that the travel agents represented a high cost, low service-quality channel and moved aggressively to get its customer base to book directly with Southwest online. As a result, Southwest was not a small player in online booking when the aggregators (Expedia, Travelocity, etc.) built their businesses. Similarly, Domino’s Pizza began in 2008 to create a digital customer experience with its ‘Pizza Tracker’ mobile app long before food delivery applications achieved meaningful scale. By 2017, 60% of Domino’s pizza were ordered via their app. Southwest and Domino’s went on the offensive and pushed scale buttons before they were pushed by somebody else. Did it eliminate the threat from aggregators? No. But going on offense early helped build scale positions that their competitors did not attempt until far too late.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="329a" name="329a">Whether your reaction is defensive or offensive matters less than whether you make a decisive choice in the face of a shift from pre-competitive to competitive.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Given the question’s frequency, and the critical importance of the answer, I am going to provide a comprehensive answer in my 27th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights piece on Can you be Both Cost Leader &amp; Differentiator. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4bb8" name="4bb8"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why the Frequency of the Question?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f590" name="f590">I think I get the question as often as I do for two reasons. First is that in advising on strategy, I emphasize the need to choose and in general people don’t like to choose. People like more to keep options open rather than cut them off, which is one reason <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-vs-planning-complements-not-substitutes-ea08e56809d6" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-vs-planning-complements-not-substitutes-ea08e56809d6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">why most strategy isn’t strategy, it is planning</a>. So, when I say one of the important strategy choices is to be either a cost leader or a differentiator, people tend react by challenging why they must choose.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d6a7" name="d6a7">Second, I am known as <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-integrative-thinking-96ac0769709b" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-integrative-thinking-96ac0769709b" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Integrative Thinking guy</a>, so they want to attempt to catch me being inconsistent by reminding me that when I talk about Integrative Thinking, I argue against making trade-offs but when I talk about strategy, I say you have to make a trade-off between being a cost leader or a differentiator. In fact, I don’t actually argue against making trade-offs. While I argue against making unpleasant trade-offs that leave you in a weak and vulnerable position, I am always in favor making choices that focus your efforts and investments in a way that enables you to win.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="93e4" name="93e4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">From Where did the Idea Come?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="87f3" name="87f3">I certainly take zero credit for the insight about choosing between cost leadership and differentiation. That was Michael Porter in his landmark 1980 strategy book, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Strategy-Techniques-Industries-Competitors/dp/0684841487/" href="https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Strategy-Techniques-Industries-Competitors/dp/0684841487/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Competitive Strategy</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">. </em>He pointed out that the greatest danger in strategy is to end up being stuck in the middle, neither a cost leader nor a differentiator, and that a company has to choose between being one or the other to avoid becoming stuck in the middle.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="646a" name="646a">Despite Michael’s relative clarity, there are problematic confusions concerning both cost leadership and differentiation. In my experience, managers mistake being cost effective for being a cost leader. To be a cost leader, you have to configure yourself uniquely in order to achieve a cost position that is meaningfully lower than for any competitor. That is what leading means. You can’t be a ‘leader’ if you are in the middle of the pack. You are cost effective if your cost position puts you in the middle of the pack. The value of a cost advantage is that you can use it to gain share. The cost advantage enables you to lower price below the level competitors can in order to gain share from them, which illustrates the problem with being stuck in the middle. You can’t protect yourself from the cost leader (or differentiator for that matter).</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7292" name="7292">Managers also confuse being <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">different</em> with being <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">differentiated</em>. You are a differentiator only if you are different in a way that compels customers to pay a meaningfully higher price for your product or service that that of an average competitor. That is, for your customer base, you can charge a meaningful price premium and still maintain a stable market share. And as with the cost leader, it puts you in a position to be able to gain market share by cutting your price premium, which makes your value proposition to customers even more attractive. Again, stuck in the middle competitors can’t protect their share from the advantaged player — this time the differentiator.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b1ab" name="b1ab"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Is it Absolutely True that you can’t be Both?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f9e3" name="f9e3">No, it is not. Every monopolist is by definition a cost leader and a differentiator. It has the lowest cost because there is no competitor for whom costs could be lower, and it charges the highest price because there is no competitor in existence to charge a higher price. Those who create a new industry (or segment thereof) often stay the dominant player even after they lose their monopoly/near-monopoly. That would include IBM in mainframes, eBay in on-line marketplaces, and Google in search.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b631" name="b631">For a time, their dominance enables them to be both the cost leader and differentiator in their industry/segment. Their dominant scale enables them to spread fixed costs over a wider base to provide a cost advantage and enables them to use some of the funds from the cost advantage to differentiate still more, for example through greater advertising intensity or higher R&amp;D spending. But the double advantage tends not to last because eventually competition arrives, and it attacks in ways that force the company to choose — or fade away.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7575" name="7575">For example, through the 1960s, IBM owned a near-monopoly in the mainframe computer business and as a result, became the most valuable company in the world as of 1967. But in the 1970s, its position was attacked by Cray Computers at the high end with mainframes that were more powerful than IBM’s, and Fujitsu and Hitachi at the low end with cheaply made IBM clones. IBM ceased to be either the cost leader or the differentiator. Instead of choosing one or the other, IBM let itself be stuck in the middle and arguably has been on a downward trajectory ever since (despite the fantasy story about its rebirth as a services powerhouse under Lou Gerstner, which illustrates the difference between being big and having advantage).</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5b64" name="5b64">For eBay, in due course Craigslist entered at the low end and companies like Etsy entered in high-end niches. And even mighty Google now has to attempt to fend off Amazon and Facebook. Most are so used to being the cost leader and differentiator while they were dominant that they don’t choose, because they don’t believe that they must. Because they were the cost leader and differentiator, they think they can still be both.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="75a3" name="75a3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why is it so Hard to be Both?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d535" name="d535">In the face of competition, it is unrealistic to be both because cost leadership and differentiation take very different disciplines. A cost leader will choose standardization and will sacrifice non-conforming customers in order to maintain its meaningfully lower costs. Southwest Airlines co-founder and longtime CEO Herb Kelleher was famous for responding to letters from customers complaining that Southwest didn’t provide features that other carriers did (e.g., business class; advanced seat selection) by encouraging the customer to use the other carriers, happily sacrificing the non-conforming customer in order to protect the standardization of his model. Differentiators will pursue deep, holistic understanding of customers so that they can build the next increment of value into their product or service. They are always innovating and building the unique value and strength of their brand. Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts has spent the past sixty years deepening its understanding of guests in order to customize the guest experience and build the strongest brand in the luxury hotel space.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2528" name="2528">If you have exclusively crummy competitors, you can simultaneously be better than them at both. But if you have a Southwest in your industry, it is virtually impossible to figure out how to achieve lower costs than it while also investing in being the most differentiated player. Or if you have a Four Seasons in your industry, it is similarly impossible to figure out how to out-differentiate it while becoming the lowest cost player. You just end up stuck in the middle and being powerless to keep the differentiator(s) and cost leader in your industry from feasting on your current market share.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="672a" name="672a">The only strategies that have produced consistent, long-run success are exceedingly choiceful in focusing on either differentiation or cost leadership. Differentiators like Four Seasons, Lego, Novo Nordisk and WestLaw have been on top of their industries for decades and show no signs of flagging. Cost leaders such as Southwest, Vanguard, and IKEA continue to have long term advantage. There is zero confusion over which strategy each is pursuing — and that is a key feature of their collective dominance in their chosen fields.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dd71" name="dd71"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e7ad" name="e7ad">Don’t waste your time thinking about being both a cost leader and a differentiator. Think instead about to which of these different paths you will commit and how to achieve cost leadership or differentiation in the space you have chosen to compete. If you are in the fortunate position of having created an industry or a distinct segment within one, use the opportunity while you are a monopoly or near-monopoly to choose which position you will defend when the competition does arrive. The likelihood of success is diminished if the thinking and work on how to outdo the cost position or differentiation of the new competitor(s) commences only after they enter and attack, as was the case for IBM.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="95e1" name="95e1">However, if you choose differentiation, it doesn’t mean that you needn’t concern yourself with cost management. Likewise, if you choose cost leadership, it doesn’t mean that you needn’t worry about customer value. To get the competitive benefits of differentiation, a differentiator must manage costs thoughtfully and aggressively to achieve cost parity with (or at least close proximity to) the average competitors. Otherwise, the company will be the second column from the right in the chart above. It will have worked hard to create the differentiator’s price premium but done so with costs so high that it is as competitively vulnerable as the average players stuck in the middle. Similarly, a cost leader must manage the quality of its offering carefully to achieve value parity with (proximity to) the average competitors or it will end up in the second column from the left, signaling that while it has worked hard to achieve low-cost position, it did so only by deprecating the offering to the extent that it can only be sold at a substantial discount — once again a competitively weak position.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="ac61" name="ac61">It is a tough enough task to win either on low cost or differentiation while achieving proximity on the other. Trying to win on both is simply a recipe for disappointment.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

My annoyance is not because of the amount of time I waste reading them — which is a lot. It is about the time some poor souls wasted putting them together. That is why I have decided to write my 28th Playing to Win Practitioner Insights post on It’s Time to Toss SWOT Analysis into the Ashbin of Strategy History. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9c96" name="9c96"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Bit of History</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="711b" name="711b">Arguably the most venerable and frequently deployed analytical tool in all of strategy is the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (aka SWOT) Analysis, which came into existence at the same time the concept of business strategy was birthed. Interestingly, despite its prominence, there is dispute over its creation. One school of thought holds that SWOT was created in the mid-1950s by some combination of C. Roland Christensen, Kenneth Andrews, and George Smith Jr., all Harvard Business School (HBS) professors who taught the longstanding capstone Business Policy course. The other school of thought — and one that is picked up and repeated online most often — is that SWOT was created in the early 1960s by a Stanford Research International (SRI) consultant named Albert Humphrey.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f78f" name="f78f">It is amazing to me that not one article on the disputed origin of SWOT takes note of the coincidence (or not) that Humphrey was an MBA student at HBS in (guess what) the mid-1950s and would have taken the required Business Policy course, probably from one of Christensen, Andrews, or Smith. My suspicion is that he either learned it at HBS and commercialized it at SRI or learned about the fundamentals of the tool at HBS and enhanced it in his consulting practice.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="596c" name="596c">In any event, SWOT came along in the seminal period of 1955 to 1965 when scholars and practitioners were attempting to define this new thing called business strategy and to engage in the untried practice of strategic planning. Unsurprisingly strategy quickly became <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-vs-planning-complements-not-substitutes-ea08e56809d6" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-vs-planning-complements-not-substitutes-ea08e56809d6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a planning exercise</a> because formal business planning had been taught and practiced since the inception of business education at the beginning of the 20th century and was comfortingly familiar to managers. Now planning needed to become ‘strategic’ — but what on earth did that entail? It turned out that SWOT became the initial answer. To be strategic, one had to step back and ask these broad questions: What are our strengths, our weaknesses, opportunities for us, and threats to us?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="53f9" name="53f9">Like any practice that builds an early mindshare lead, SWOT maintained and built on that lead so much so that half a century later, a strategic planning process is more likely than not to be kicked off with a SWOT analysis.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="772a" name="772a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Problem with SWOT</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3ba1" name="3ba1">When I give a strategy talk, I often ask the audience:<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> Who here has either performed or received a SWOT analysis? </em>Virtually all members of every audience put up their hands because SWOT is such a prominent tool that everyone has both performed and reviewed numerous SWOT analyses. I then ask: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Who can tell me a blinding insight that came out of any such SWOT analysis? </em>I am still waiting for my first hand on that second question. Not one single audience member has raised his or her hand to tell me of a decisive insight from a SWOT analysis. That is pretty damning given the millions of person-hours per year that are spent on performing and reviewing SWOTs. Not one non-intuitive strength arose out of a SWOT. Not one fascinating weakness was unearthed. Not one terrific opportunity was brought to light. Not one damaging threat was anticipated.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="49ce" name="49ce">It is not because SWOT analyses aren’t thoroughly done. They are typically monumental, running to hundreds of pages of charts, graphs, and tables. The problem is that the task itself is conceived in a way that makes it inherently undoable.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3632" name="3632">Consider the strengths analysis. To be able to analyze one’s strengths, one has to have a definition of what is contained in the category ‘strengths’ and a way of measuring whatever is included. But a strength is only a strength in the context of a particular Where-to-Play/How-to-Win (WTP/HTW) choice. If it turns out that your HTW specifies that you will win based on the broadest product line, then having a broad product line would properly show up as a strength in your SWOT. But if instead, it turns out that having the most reliable and consistent delivery is your HTW, then breadth of product line might actually be a weakness, and certainly isn’t a strength. At the start of a process to determine strategy, you just don’t know the WTP/HTW choice you will eventually make, which means you can’t determine anything particularly insightful about your strengths. That is why the strengths analysis in SWOT is so bland, generic, and undiscriminating.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2672" name="2672">The same thing applies to weaknesses. A weakness is only a weakness in the context of a particular WTP/HTW choice. And the same applies to opportunities and to threats. It is a threat if there is a new entrant in a given WTP, but only if you choose to play there. That is why there is blandness across SWOT analyses. You can’t be specific about strengths or weaknesses in advance of a WTP/HTW choice. It isn’t obvious what is or is not an opportunity or a threat at the outset of a strategy process. Hence by accidental design, SWOT analyses are a mile wide and an inch deep, generating lots of work and lots of pages, but producing little insight.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3e2c" name="3e2c"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Better Way</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c2d2" name="c2d2">The superior approach is to perform an analysis only when you are clear on the specific purpose so that you can go a mile deep and an inch wide. That means you don’t do it up front as with the SWOT and you don’t attempt to make it excessively broad like the four-pronged SWOT. Wait for analysis. Be patient. Don’t jump in before you have thought about what you are doing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="11df" name="11df">Start by defining the strategy problem you are seeking to solve. That is, what is the gap between your aspirations and the outcomes you are seeking. Then specify the form of the solution by way of a ‘how might we’ question. That is, how might we eliminate the identified gap that we currently face. Then imagine possibilities of WTP/HTW choices that have the potential of answering the how might we question to eliminate the gap between aspirations and outcomes. Then for each possibility, ask what would have to be true (WWHTBT) for it to produce the desired outcome. Then identify which WWHTBT elements you feel are least likely to be true and therefore are the barriers to you choosing to go forward with that possibility.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6aa7" name="6aa7">Then and only then, when you have precise understanding of both the question you are seeking to answer and the standard of proof you require, design specific tests for the elements that are critical to your choice. Your patience will be rewarded with analyses that are far more precise and and produce much more compelling results.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a785" name="a785"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Science versus Data Mining</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="269e" name="269e">The SWOT issue is only one manifestation of a broader problem of the misuse of science in data analytics. With ever-greater computing power, analysts can crunch huge datasets, spreadsheets with endless rows and columns, to look for patterns and correlations. Because it involves numbers and analysis, it feels scientific. But it isn’t. It is just data mining — and if you torture data enough, it will give you something! It will give you correlations without underlying cause, trends without meaning, etc.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6850" name="6850">Analysis is only scientific if it starts with an explicit hypothesis. That doesn’t include implicit ones — “I think x, but I am going to keep that to myself until I see what the data say.” The hypothesis will guide the analysis with scientific precision: what data should be crunched, in what manner, and with what standard of proof.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bade" name="bade">Unfortunately, SWOT is classic data mining. It collects vast tracts of data with no hypothesis (other than these four vaguely named categories) and hopes something useful pops out, which my audience question reveals doesn’t happen. Or worse yet, the people performing the SWOT do have hypotheses, but they are kept secret. So, they impose their theories on the data collection and analysis but will tell you it is an objective analysis while they guide it to the desired conclusion.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0c58" name="0c58">SWOT was created in the early days of strategy when early practitioners were desperate for tools. But it has become a monstrous time-sink with little or no compensating value. It needs to be relegated to the ashbin of strategy history.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="274b" name="274b"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b1ac" name="b1ac">This one is pretty simple: never do a SWOT analysis. And never pay attention to a SWOT analysis you happen to receive. At best, it is a waste of time. At worst, it will distract you from creating and rigorously testing your strategic logic.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="9b2e" name="9b2e">More generally, never do an analysis without first generating an hypothesis. Otherwise, you will engage in aimless data mining. Some people are fearful that holding an hypothesis before testing it will result in bias — for example by anchoring on the answer suggested by your hypothesis. It is a challenge. Anchoring is real. However, it is worse to have no hypothesis at all because you can’t advance your thinking rigorously without forming and testing hypotheses. My advice on this front is a slight modification of the admonition to have a strong opinion that is loosely held. I think that a strong opinion can cause others to take offense. I believe that you should always have a clear opinion that is loosely held. It means that you take the time to form an explicit hypothesis to guide your actions. That will enable you to continuously improve your understanding of the world around you, and that will make you a better strategy practitioner!</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

(Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f43a" name="f43a">When I work with tech companies, I find it striking how ambivalent most are about strategy. They tend to see it as an unhelpful bureaucratic planning exercise in an industry is too fast moving for strategy. On the former, they are right to be skeptical. As I have written about in this series, most strategic planning is <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-vs-planning-complements-not-substitutes-ea08e56809d6" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-vs-planning-complements-not-substitutes-ea08e56809d6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dominantly planning and not strategic</a>. However, the latter is a fallacy that I have also written about in this series. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-is-what-you-do-not-what-you-say-a6e483840557" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-is-what-you-do-not-what-you-say-a6e483840557" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Everybody has a strategy</a> — it is what they do, so whether they admit it or not, every tech company has a strategy no matter how fast-moving its industry is.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="140b" name="140b">But tech companies are almost universally enthusiastic about product marketing. When I ask them, they describe a great product marketer as one who thoroughly and insightfully understands the market and what motivates customers across the various segments; is capable of determining what attributes the product (service) needs to embody to prevail against competition; can wisely choose the segment(s) to target; and is skilled in designing an effective go-to-market as well as the accompanying communications approach.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8eef" name="8eef">When I hear that, it sounds very familiar because it is strategy: Where to Play/How to Win (WTP/HTW). This is not surprising because during the late 20th century marketing and strategy began the process of converging and now, they are indistinguishable, so the Silicon Valley view is not wrong: product marketing <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is </em>strategy. That is why I have made my 28th post in the Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights series It’s Time to Accept that Marketing and Strategy are One Discipline.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e50c" name="e50c"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How on Earth did this Happen?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9cf1" name="9cf1">Marketing began life as a formal discipline focused on the customer and the company. At its inception in the beginning of the 20th century, its first concern was segmentation of customers. Early marketers tried to create meaningful categories — mainly socio-economic ones in that era — to help companies target their products better. Segmentation of this type guided General Motors to develop “a car for every purse and purpose.” In the 1920s, marketers developed customer research methodologies to help companies better understand their customers. In 1960, Jerome McCarthy created the Four Ps model, the ‘marketing mix’ of product, price, place, and promotion, that helped companies plan how to deploy their resources to encourage customers to purchase their offerings. As a discipline, the focus was on the customer and company, and the interactions between them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3554" name="3554">Strategy as a formal business discipline came into existence half a century later in the middle of the 20th century. Its origins were in military strategy, an ancient discipline. Even today, business strategists read Sun Tzu’s <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-War-Sun-Tzu/dp/081331951X/" href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-War-Sun-Tzu/dp/081331951X/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Art of War</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>written in the fifth century BC (as I write this, it ranks 3rd among Strategy &amp; Competition books on Amazon — in an amazing accomplishment for a 2,500-year-old book) and Carl von Clausewitz’s 1832 classic <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/War-Carl-von-Clausewitz/dp/1640320806/" href="https://www.amazon.com/War-Carl-von-Clausewitz/dp/1640320806/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">On War</em></a>. The focus of military strategy has always been on the state and its adversary(s) and the interactions between them. The citizen didn’t play a big role. Military strategy largely assumes that citizens will be happy with and approve of the triumph over a sworn enemy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="47df" name="47df">Having arisen out of military strategy, business strategy unsurprisingly began with a focus on company (equivalent of the state) and competition (the adversary). Boston Consulting Group founder Bruce Henderson, the father of business strategy, was responsible for the development and deployment of the first successful strategy tool in the 1960’s: The Experience Curve. The approach assumed that production costs dropped by 20–30% with each doubling of cumulative output of a given product. Thus, if a company priced ‘ahead of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/1973/corporate-finance-strategy-portfolio-management-experience-curve-reviewed-part-ii-the-history" href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/1973/corporate-finance-strategy-portfolio-management-experience-curve-reviewed-part-ii-the-history" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Experience Curve</a>’ (i.e., at a price that would be profitable at a cost position which would be achieved only when the company got farther down the Experience Curve) to ensure that it achieved a market share lead over competitors, it would always have a lower cost position than competitors and would continue to dominate the product category in question.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8340" name="8340">Note that this is all about two actors: the company and the competition. Customers are largely a passive actor in this world. They buy product primarily from the provider that enjoys the lowest cost position and therefore can be sharpest on price.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7d69" name="7d69">As a result of this evolution, when I began my career of working with companies on strategy in 1981, I observed marketing as a discipline primarily concerned with the interaction of companies and customers versus strategy which was concerned with the interaction of companies and competitors. Of course, competitors weren’t 100% absent for the marketing discipline. The product and price aspects of the 4P’s needed to be considered relative to competition. But when working with marketers, I typically had to push them pretty hard to consider how competitors would react to their prospective 4P choices. Similarly, customers weren’t 100% absent for strategy. Somebody was buying those products influenced by the learning curve. Yet I always wondered why strategists didn’t pay more attention to customer behavior.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f63b" name="f63b">For each discipline, the dominant focus was on two of the three central actors in business: companies for both disciplines plus customers for one, plus competitors for the other. But over time, both disciplines recognized that they needed to integrate the third actor more centrally into their work. Michael Porter provided a push to include the customer more centrally in strategy with his introduction of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Strategy-Techniques-Industries-Competitors/dp/0684841487" href="https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Strategy-Techniques-Industries-Competitors/dp/0684841487" rel="noopener" target="_blank">differentiation as a generic strategy</a>. For that strategy, a company had to deeply understand customers to provide unique value to them. Later, elements of design, including the deep, ethnographically driven understanding of users and rapid, iterative prototyping with them, were <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-design-thinking-faf6b787160b" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-design-thinking-faf6b787160b" rel="noopener" target="_blank">incorporated into strategy</a>.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fafe" name="fafe">At the same time, marketers increasingly recognized that the role of competitors needed to be integrated more fully into their discipline. For example, in 1985 the Journal of Marketing Research, the premier academic journal in marketing, dedicated an entire special issue to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3151422?seq=1" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3151422?seq=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Competition in Marketing</a>. In 2009, marketing guru Professor Philip Kotler declared the marketing discipline to be in its fifth era, the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Management-13th-Phil-Kotler/dp/0136009980" href="https://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Management-13th-Phil-Kotler/dp/0136009980" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Holistic Marketing Era</a>, which recognized the more inclusive view of actors that the marketing discipline had adopted in the modern era.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8ee5" name="8ee5"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Convergence</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8c86" name="8c86">The full addition of competitors to the marketer’s focus and of customers to the strategist’s focus have caused the jobs of marketers and strategists to converge on the same thing. At their best, both marketers and strategists seek to determine WTP/HTW and use similar tools to evaluate customers, competitors, and the company to make that decision. They now have the same job — just with different titles.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e7f9" name="e7f9">Now I realize that within the marketing function, there are some specialists who do things like buy media or supervise the creation of advertising copy. And in the strategy function, there are specialists who work on M&amp;A deals or in project management. I also recognize that all strategists haven’t integrated the customer into their considerations and all marketers haven’t fully integrated competitors.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ecda" name="ecda">But done correctly, the core job of marketers and strategists have become the same. If a marketer does a great job at considering customers, competitors, and the company to make an excellent WTP/HTW choice, there is nothing important left for the strategist to do. And if a strategist does a great job at considering customers, competitors, and the company to make an excellent WTP/HTW choice, there is nothing important left for the marketer to do.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="283a" name="283a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Duplication in the Modern Corporation</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="af04" name="af04">As a consequence, the modern corporation embodies massive duplication. It doesn’t need both a marketing function and a strategy function. They are as likely to get in one another’s way as to add value. I fear, in fact, that the existence of both gets in the way of each becoming fully tripartite — i.e., fully incorporating customers, competitors and company into their decisions.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="87ff" name="87ff">I have no intent to disparage either function. I love both marketers and strategists! The disciplines behind both functions have gotten better and better over time. That is a good thing. But the inadvertent outcome of the growth in the disciplines has been a collision between them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="690f" name="690f">The bottom line is that you don’t need both functions in the modern corporation. I can only imagine the reaction: that’s not possible, Roger. But look at P&amp;G — world’s 15th largest market capitalization company and most successful consumer packaged goods company. It has no strategy function. Beginning the late 1980s, its marketers broadened their skillsets to incorporate the tripartite view. Converging to a single function is bold; but it is neither undoable nor harmful when done.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="150c" name="150c"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Duplication in Business Education</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c876" name="c876">I know of no business school on the planet that does not have separate marketing and strategy departments. Because business schools specialize in being slow to adapt and those disciplines have always been separate and distinct, they remain that way today, and will persist. As a result, business schools are a force in ensuring the continuation of a phantom distinction that is not helpful to students or the firms that hire them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2dd1" name="2dd1"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b807" name="b807">If you are running a company, converge marketing and strategy. I couldn’t care less what you call it. You just don’t need two functions doing the same core job (with perhaps some unique sidelights). Keep great people from both current functions — it isn’t a takeover of one by the other. Just don’t have them competing to make the same set of choices.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="54b6" name="54b6">If you are working in the bowels of a marketing or strategy function, collaborate with the other function. You are doing the same job. The worst possible outcome is to have a marketing plan and a strategic plan that are inconsistent. Work together as collaborating teammates to make a single one. That will contribute most to business success.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="6991" name="6991">If you are a business school Dean, or you are a Marketing or Strategy Professor, I know you won’t merge departments, so I won’t even ask. I know that already, you can barely keep behavioral marketing and econometric marketing from insisting on splitting into two separate departments to stop the internecine warfare. But for the sake of the students, teach one thing. I don’t care who teaches it — marketing professors or strategy professors. But don’t teach as if the task of strategy and of marketing are different: they aren’t. Otherwise, you will continue to confuse students and send them out into the world destined to perpetuate the current corporate duplication and dysfunction.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

(Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b5d7" name="b5d7"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Manipulation of Quantities</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f3c2" name="f3c2">Because of the origins of the practice, the prototypical strategy person is an analytical wizard/geek. Institutions tend to shape themselves in the image of a seminal figure. Generations of pilots use a laconic drawl in cockpit communications because that is how seminal test pilot hero Chuck Yeager did it. The father of business strategy and founder of Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Bruce Henderson was a Vanderbilt mechanical engineer and Harvard MBA (though he famously dropped out weeks before graduation). [If you prefer to view Michael Porter as the father of strategy, he is a Princeton aeronautical engineer (yes literally a rocket scientist), Harvard MBA, and Harvard PhD in business economics.]</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5923" name="5923">As BCG grew into the creator of the huge new industry of strategy consulting, it preferred to staff its ranks with Baker Scholars (top 5%) from HBS, with the absolute favorite being undergraduate engineers combined with a Harvard MBA — or later an MBA from one of the other great business schools. BCG’s ‘case interviews,’ which gave little analytical brainteasers, such as how many golf balls could you fit inside the Empire State Building, became the norm for screening entry into not only BCG but the entire industry. And the graduates of BCG, McKinsey, Bain, Monitor, etc. populate the strategy functions of today’s corporations. In a reinforcing loop, the desires of those consulting firms shape the curricula of business schools who want to place their graduates in these high-paying jobs.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="19b9" name="19b9">The entire ethos of strategy as a practice centers on manipulation of quantities. To be very clear, I don’t mean manipulation in any bad way but rather in a literal way. I mean performing an operation of some sort on numerical variables to produce a useful output. Before you even get to kindergarten, you are likely to learn your first quantitative manipulation technique: counting. The technique enables you to know something important: how many of a given thing you have.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6fcf" name="6fcf">When you enter the formal educational system, you learn a succession of increasingly sophisticated quantitative manipulation techniques, starting with addition, then subtraction, then multiplication, then division, then algebra, trigonometry, and calculus. In most college disciplines, you will be taught statistics. Depending on your particular discipline, you might also learn fluid dynamics, electrical resistance, or heat transfer, etc. If you go to business school, you will learn about IRR, NPV, ROI, EBITDA, CAPM, Black-Scholes, EOQ, SPC and more.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="60e6" name="60e6">In your strategy courses, you will learn about Nash Equilibria, relative market share, relative cost position, the learning curve and more. The dominant motif of strategy is the manipulation of quantities to produce a prescription for action. This motif dominates the strategy firms and the strategy function in corporations. Like the pilot acolytes of Yeager, these are the acolytes of Henderson.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8c71" name="8c71"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Appreciation of Qualities</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e194" name="e194">But many things in life are not quantifiable. And with respect to these them, the manipulation of quantities is useless. Think about going to a newly curated Impressionist show at the Musée d’Orsay. If all you had at your disposal were tools for manipulating quantities, you could say: “I saw 168 Impressionist paintings. Monet’s 57 pieces earned #1 market share of 34%. They were shown in 16 rooms or 10.5 paintings/room. The paintings covered 944 square feet or 5.6 sq ft/painting. The dominant color was blue with 147 square feet or a 11% market share of colors.” None of those outputs is of consequential value.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e27c" name="e27c">If you had a different skill set, you might come out of the show saying: “That was the most fascinating curation of an Impressionist show that I have attended. The show was organized by contemporaneous non-Impressionist influences. It became clear that at the same time the Impressionists were breaking radical new ground in painting, they were watching the evolution of more traditional painters and incorporating attributes of that work. I have seen shows by chronology, by painter, by theme, but never using this lens. I learned something new and exciting about the evolution of the Impressionist movement.” That is a useful output.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="79c7" name="79c7">It illustrates the second skill set, which is the appreciation of qualities. There is nothing quantitative in the latter interpretation. Numbers do not help. In this case, you need to understand the differences between the various Impressionist painters, how they differed from their contemporaries, and how the work of both groups evolved. The finer the qualitative distinctions of which you are capable, the more useful inferences you can make about the exhibition.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6ed0" name="6ed0">That is the appreciation of qualities: the knowledge of a domain (in this case Impressionist art) that enables you to make finer distinctions. If you are a Sommelier, you can make a distinction between a 1985 and 1986 Bordeaux in a blind tasting. If you a Cordon Bleu chef, you can tell the difference between medium and medium-rare from several feet away, not only after cutting into the steak as is the case for me!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8a1d" name="8a1d"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Strategy and Qualitative Appreciation</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="db83" name="db83">Much of strategy is inherently qualitative. You need to gauge the emotional and psychological interests and desires of consumers. You need to intuit competitors’ intentions and make predictions as to their moves. You need to understand the hopes and dreams of employees, and how they vary from one employee to the next. You need to sense how technology is evolving and what it means to your business. You simply can’t be a useful strategist without sophistication on these qualitative fronts. No amount of quantitative manipulation can save you. It can and will help you. But to be a strategist, you need to have a fine appreciation of qualities alongside the capacity to manipulate quantities.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="02d1" name="02d1"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Fundamental Problem</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3e34" name="3e34">The primary training of strategists is wildly biased toward manipulation of quantities and not appreciation of qualities. The vast majority of MBAs hold an undergrad in either engineering, business, or economics. In the MBA, there is very little useful course material on appreciation of qualities. The business school culture holds that manipulation of quantities <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is </em></strong>business, leading to a belief in graduates that the existing imbalance is an inherently good thing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e58e" name="e58e">It is not as though strategists have no appreciation of qualities. Like all human beings, they develop qualitative appreciation across their lives as a matter of course. But the development is informal and is typically given a low priority. University students do formally develop appreciation of qualities, but only in substantial parts of the humanities and tiny slivers of the social sciences. They may be schooled in the discipline of art appreciation or literary criticism or graphic design or ethnography. But undergraduates with formal education in the appreciation of qualities make up less than one-tenth of MBA students.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c7ff" name="c7ff">As a result, the field of business strategy is extremely unbalanced. It is as if Arnold Schwarzenegger never exercised his left arm. He could lift hundreds of pounds with his right arm and couldn’t lift a can of soup above his shoulder with his left.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fb39" name="fb39"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="92cc" name="92cc">If you are a strategist, stop worshipping at the altar of manipulation of quantities. Instead, seek balance. If you are weak on the appreciation of qualities: get to work on it. My advice is to go to a wine tasting or cooking or art appreciation course. Discover how one formally learns to appreciate — to make finer and finer qualitative distinctions. The way you develop qualitative appreciation is through practice with the medium in question combined with critique by masters of and peers in the medium. That is why your final exam in an art, design, or music class is not a multiple-choice quiz but rather a crit. It is because there aren’t any ‘right answers’ in qualitative appreciation. There are just more or less masterful interpretations. With guidance, practice, and critique, you will become more masterful.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="94e6" name="94e6">And start treating strategy as a qualitative appreciation exercise as much as a quantitative manipulation process. Be conscious of your own qualitative assessments. Don’t be ashamed of them because they aren’t quantitatively based: that is an important feature, not a bug! Share them with masters and peers to sharpen your interpretation skills. Practice and practice strategy with a purpose.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="fe0c" name="fe0c">CEOs frequently ask me for advice on unblocking the development of senior executives. The story is almost always the same. Though they don’t describe it in these terms, the CEO critique is that the executive is awesome at quantitative manipulation and dreadful at qualitative appreciation. Typically, the manifestation is ‘he is just tone-deaf with people’ or ‘she can’t innovate/embrace innovation’ or ‘customers fear him more than love him.’ They are shocked at my prescription. It is to send the individual to a Sommelier course or cooking school or an art appreciation course at the local museum. My reasoning is that it is doubtful that the executive has ever had a lick of formal training in the appreciation of qualities and needs to have that experience — which the executive can then port over into business (and if unable, it is prima facie evidence that the executive has already reached terminal position in the company).</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Martin, 2021</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="76ae" name="76ae">I am utterly tired of the modern strategy focus on averages, whether means, medians, or modes. It is Achilles Heel of data analytics/Big Data/Artificial Intelligence. That is why I am dedicating my 31st Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) to encouraging strategists to go beyond obsessing about averages. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="92b8" name="92b8"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Modern Focus on Averages</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="756c" name="756c">In world of strategy, all analytical guns have long been trained on means, medians, and modes. What is the most representative customer behavior? What is the biggest customer need? What is the average cost of our product? How do most people get information about our product? What is the average life of our customers? What is the biggest segment?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1642" name="1642">Data analytics just exacerbates this tendency. It generally involves compiling a big data set and then applying analytical techniques to look for patterns. What, generally speaking, constitutes a pattern? It tends to be lots of something: the middle of the distribution. What do most customers buy? Where do we make the most profit? Etc.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7fbd" name="7fbd">It particular, data analytics is about finding lots of something that has already happened. As I have argued for decades (for example <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2011/09/you-cant-analyze-your-way-to-g.html" href="https://hbr.org/2011/09/you-cant-analyze-your-way-to-g.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-on-books/author-talks-roger-martin-on-the-high-price-of-efficiency" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-on-books/author-talks-roger-martin-on-the-high-price-of-efficiency" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>), 100% of the world’s data is from the past. So, when data analytics looks for its prevailing patterns, it is looking for patterns that are prevalent in the period leading up to the present.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="808c" name="808c">It isn’t wrongheaded to seek better insight on what, in the main, is happening now. It is valuable, but for one thing and one thing only: optimizing what is. That is what comes out of data analytics in strategy. As long as the world stays the way it is, optimizing to how things currently are now, on average, is sensible and valuable.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1c18" name="1c18"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Aversion to the Outliers</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c84b" name="c84b">The flip side of obsession with averages is aversion to the outliers. They are largely ignored if not entirely suppressed. Until I spoke to one of the world’s leading Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) researchers, I had always thought that the Human Genome Project, biggest medical project in medical history, had sequenced the human genome. Instead, researchers took several hundred individual human genomes and created a kind of average composite genome which was then sequenced. All anomalies were eliminated. They were no longer in the picture during the sequencing process and today it is as if outliers in the genome never existed.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fc85" name="fc85">There is a cost to this aversion. While the mean tells you about what is operating today, outliers give you hints about the future. The above ASD researcher, Dr. Stephen Scherer, is responsible for a cornucopia of new knowledge and insights on the genetic roots of autism. He asserts that all of his research breakthroughs have resulted from <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2009/11/two-leading-researchers-discuss-the-value-of-oddball-data" href="https://hbr.org/2009/11/two-leading-researchers-discuss-the-value-of-oddball-data" rel="noopener" target="_blank">looking for genetic anomalies</a> — things that shouldn’t be there based on the averages as represented by the Human Genome Project results. He jokingly describes his success as stemming exclusively from rifling through the garbage can of genomics!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="33c5" name="33c5">Scherer’s method and experiences are generalizable. Outliers are a window on the future. Science fiction writer William Gibson was right when he argued that “The future is already here — it’s just not evenly distributed yet.” The future is revealed in the outliers that will become the mean someday. Bob Dylan was booed at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 for the outlier affront of playing an electric guitar in a non-rock festival. Within a decade, it would become the mode. Mutual fund buyers were fringe investors in the 1960s and 1970s. But they saw something that mainstream investors at the time had not yet figured out: a basket of stocks was less subject to manipulation by insiders than an individual stock. Now mutual funds (whether traditional or exchange-traded) is the dominant form of stock ownership by individual investors. Steve jobs wasn’t paying attention to corporate users of computers but rather the fringe of hackers and geeks — which in due course became you and me. MAC Cosmetics designed its offering for professional make-up artists but in due course became mainstream. Shopify helped the long tail of small-scale creatives sell online and now is the back end for huge mainstream companies.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="466b" name="466b">The idea that today’s fringe ideas often migrate to the mainstream is not a new insight. In 1997, Malcolm Gladwell wrote one of his legendary articles on this phenomenon in <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/03/17/the-coolhunt" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/03/17/the-coolhunt" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Coolhunt</em></a>. There have been entire <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Deviants-Advantage-Fringe-Create-Markets/dp/0609609580" href="https://www.amazon.com/Deviants-Advantage-Fringe-Create-Markets/dp/0609609580" rel="noopener" target="_blank">books</a> written about learning from the fringe. It has long been clear that deeply probing what is going on with and what inference to draw from the behavior of outliers is really smart.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f8cc" name="f8cc">The problem is that our analytical mindset and toolbox has migrated away from paying attention to the outliers. In fact, there is an entire data analytics practice area that provides instructions for preventing outliers from <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.dynamicyield.com/lesson/outliers-detection/" href="https://www.dynamicyield.com/lesson/outliers-detection/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">‘threatening’ your data analysis</a>. You want to remove those nasty outliers from your precious dataset! Much of the suppression occurs without us realizing it. I suspect like me, you thought that medical researchers sequenced a human genome. We don’t realize that we are obsessing more about <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what is</em> while increasingly averting our eyes to what would help us imagine <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what could be</em>. What could be doesn’t appear instantly from nowhere. It is already lurking in the fringes.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b54c" name="b54c">That is understood in one part of the data analytics/artificial intelligence world, mainly in the world of security, where anomaly detection is key. In that world, what doesn’t kill you is everyday traffic, it is the anomalous terrorist-to-terrorist message. Or what doesn’t kill you is the mean performance metrics of your nuclear reactor; it is the anomalous signals of fission gone rogue. So, it is not as though sophisticated data analytical techniques can’t pay attention to and draw valuable insights from outliers — it is just that in modern business they rarely ever do. And that is one of the reasons that there is a strong correlation between the rise of data analysis and the dissatisfaction of corporations with their pace and level of innovation. You aren’t going to find new things obsessing about averages.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c4f3" name="c4f3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3908" name="3908">The single most important thing to do is to think consciously and carefully about when you pay attention to averages and when to outliers. When you want to hone and refine <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what is</em>, focus on the averages and ignore the outliers. Outliers will distract you when creating improvement for the middle of the distribution is your goal. That is why the Human Genome Project focused on a composite average genome — though much of the advance hype about it finding fantastic breakthrough insights was not realized.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e82a" name="e82a">If you want to figure out <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what could be, </em>you have to pay attention to the outliers. If you want to figure out new things about an outlier condition like ASD, then you need to pay attention to data gleaned from observing outliers. You must avoid listening to the siren song of the averages that is often embedded in the analytical tools you are using. If a data analytical specialist gives you results from an analysis, it is more than likely that the outliers have been scrubbed from the dataset without you being told. That is why it is always important to ask to see the outliers along with the averages.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="ea8c" name="ea8c">When you think about outliers, ask what about the outlier is totally sensible. Don’t focus on what is silly, stupid or egomaniacal about the outlier. Dylan had a reason for playing an electric guitar. Mutual fund investors weren’t necessarily unsophisticated. Hackers and geeks just were more willing than the average user to sacrifice computing power for power over their computer. Focus on what could be a not yet evenly distributed future. That will help you be a better and more creative strategist.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Martin, 2021</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="a1ab" name="a1ab">These days, the strategy subject about which I get asked most frequently is ‘digital strategy.’ How can my strategy benefit from digital transformation? How does Playing to Win apply to digital strategy? Because of the sheer volume of these related questions, I am dedicating my 32nd Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece to What is Digital Strategy, Anyway? (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b774" name="b774"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why the Fascination?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ec4a" name="ec4a">There is endless fascination about digital strategy in the business world today, which if you are not engaging in, your company is written off as a dinosaur lumbering around in the 21st century just waiting to fall into a tar pit. The fascination stems from the speed to massive domination of digital natives like Google, Facebook, Netflix, and hordes of smaller unicorns. Every traditional company wants to digitally transform itself to be just like these digital winners.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9aa1" name="9aa1">Before declaring digital strategy/transformation to be the path to follow, it is important to understand the Where-to-Play/How-to-Win (WTP/HTW) choices of these outsized winners. A key feature of the WTP choice is an entirely digital product (though it wasn’t at first for Netflix). That matters because the marginal cost of production is zero (or darn close). A key feature of the HTW is customer self-serve. For the bulk of sales these companies make, the customer does the majority of the work, making the marginal cost of consummating the sale zero (or darn close). Zero-zero marginal costs is a dream come true in which incremental revenue falls right to the bottom line.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ad83" name="ad83">That fundamental WTP/HTW choice — a 100% digital product purchased largely through customer self-serve is at the core of their spectacular success and crazy-high <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/217489/revenue-per-employee-of-selected-tech-companies/" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/217489/revenue-per-employee-of-selected-tech-companies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revenue per employee numbers</a>: Netflix — $2.34M, Facebook $1.57M, and Google $1.36M. Even fantastic traditional industry leaders like J&amp;J ($635K) or JPMC ($465K) have a fraction of the people productively of these leaders. And if you throw in network effects, by which the addition of another customer makes the existing customers better off, as at Facebook, this WTP/HTW choice of digital/self-serve becomes even more powerful.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="009d" name="009d">While these companies may fuel consultant pitches for the digital transformation of traditional companies, that is a pipe dream. Converting J&amp;J and JPMC entirely to digital/self-serve isn’t going to happen. What is going to happen is that innumerable digital/self-serve space start-ups are going to keep coming at existing competitors like the Mongol hordes. The fact that 90% or more of them have been and will continue to be abysmal failures is irrelevant. That is why the Mongol hordes were, well, horde-sized: all that was required was for a small fraction of the horde to survive long enough to breach the walls and the adversary was doomed. That is what keeps the traditional players up at night — and buying digital transformation services.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="328b" name="328b">For an existing player that didn’t begin life digital/self-serve, there are three useful ways to pursue digital initiatives.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ff13" name="ff13"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Migrate Your Product Mix toward Digital Products</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="be6e" name="be6e">For many traditional companies, the product in question can’t be converted to digital. P&amp;G needs to sell detergent, J&amp;J Band-Aids, Apple iPhones, etc. But you can build an adjacent related business that is digital/self-serve with (near) zero marginal production and distribution costs.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ea55" name="ea55">Because Apple’s core business is PCs, tablets and smartphones, Apple has to manufacture a physical artifact and get it to you, making Apple fundamentally dissimilar to Google, Facebook, and Netflix. However, Apple has built the App Store, a clever digital/self-serve business that supports its core business. And it has gotten huge — <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars" rel="noopener" target="_blank">$64 billion at last estimate</a>, just under a quarter of Apple’s revenues. In a year or two at most, the App Store will be bigger than P&amp;G and Walt Disney, leaders in their fields that took a century or more to get that size. And it is scary to think just how profitable the App Store is based on its beautiful WTP/HTW model.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e6d2" name="e6d2">Similarly, Amazon’s traditional online retailing business entails getting a physical product to the customer and hence its revenue/employee is an old-fashioned $352K (diminished as well by buying retailer Whole Foods). But Amazon is not, of course, oblivious to the beauty of digital/self-serve. Its biggest, fastest growing, and likely most profitable business is <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2021/02/05/amazons-third-party-marketplace-is-its-cash-cow-not-aws/?sh=a38eaf021c03" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2021/02/05/amazons-third-party-marketplace-is-its-cash-cow-not-aws/?sh=a38eaf021c03" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Marketplace</a>, which is a lovely digital/self-serve business that sticks the 3rd party vendor with the physical part of the process. (Plus, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is digital and at least partially self-serve.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="579f" name="579f">But it is not just the tech giants. In 2002, traditional and venerable newspaper Financial Times, under the direction of Chrystia Freeland (now Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of Canada), relaunched FT.com, a digital/self-serve extension of its newspaper business, which has generated <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://commercial.ft.com/audience/" href="https://commercial.ft.com/audience/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a digital subscriber base that is 80% of FT’s total</a>. Soon FT.com will have as many paying customers as FT had total subscribers at the time of the relaunch. Freeland’s brilliant digital strategy may enable FT to be the last newspaper standing on the planet.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="268d" name="268d"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Migrate your Distribution to Digital Self-Serve</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3072" name="3072">There is a glorious history of using self-serve to enhance the consumer experience while improving the cost structure of the provider. Until <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/12/25/piggly-wiggly-the-first-true-self-service-grocery-store/" href="https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/12/25/piggly-wiggly-the-first-true-self-service-grocery-store/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Piggly Wiggly opened the first self-serve grocery store</a> in 1916, shoppers had to line up to have a clerk assemble their basket of purchases from shelves inaccessible to shoppers. With that innovation, the customer experience was transformed and costs to serve plummeted. Until <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.ncr.com/blogs/banking/history-atm-innovation" href="https://www.ncr.com/blogs/banking/history-atm-innovation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chemical Bank pioneered the Automated Teller Machine</a> (ATM) in 1969, customers needed to line-up in a bank branch to have a teller give them the cash that they needed. Thereafter you could get it anytime, anywhere and the bank didn’t need a human being involved.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="13f9" name="13f9">In the digital age, the possibilities for digital self-serve are, of course, endless. Even if your product is physical, you can transform fulfilment to digital — as with McDonald’s ordering kiosks or the self-serve websites of banks.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0db3" name="0db3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Digitize an Internal Operation</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dda1" name="dda1">The third form of digital strategy/digital transformation is to deploy digital technologies to do more efficiently an internal activity. It is certainly important but not particularly new. I wrote about this years ago in <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Business-Thinking-Competitive-Advantage/dp/1422177807/" href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Business-Thinking-Competitive-Advantage/dp/1422177807/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Design of Business</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">. </em>All knowledge proceeds through a funnel starting as a broad mystery (why do objects fall to the ground), getting refined into a narrower heuristic (there is a universal force, gravity, that pushes everything toward the ground), and finally to a specific, declarative algorithm (objects accelerate downward at 32 ft/second-squared). Over the past 60 years or so, everything that we have driven to an algorithm becomes feasible to code and perform via digital computer. As a result, business has been digitizing things for half a century, whether robotics on an assembly line or Computer-aided Design/Computer-aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) or Enterprise Resource Management (ERM) systems. It used to be that you needed an experienced and wise finance person to pull together the quarter-end financials from across the business. Then SAP and Oracle (and later Salesforce) came along and turned that heuristic into an algorithm, then coded it, and now it happens largely without human intervention.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2837" name="2837"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Categorizing/Ranking Digital Strategy/Digital Transformations</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b788" name="b788">From a strategy perspective, I see these three approaches very differently. All the buzz comes from the digital/self-serve WTP/HTW — whether the whole company (Google, Facebook, Netflix) or a big add-on business (Apple, Amazon). If it weren’t for FAANG, the digital transformation hype would be a fraction of what it is. A digital/self-service WTP/HTW choice is real strategy. It takes clever choices on where exactly to play and how to create distinctive customer value. It doesn’t just optimize what is. It creates new value. In geeky economist terms, it moves out the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production%E2%80%93possibility_frontier" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production%E2%80%93possibility_frontier" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Production Possibility Frontier</a> (PPF) to the benefit of both the innovating firm and society.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b02b" name="b02b">Lagging the pure play in value but still with the opportunity for strategic uniqueness is the migration of distribution to self-serve. In the spirit of Piggly Wiggly and Chemical Bank, there are clever ways available across most industries. More recently, Dell Computers rocketed to fame and fortune in part of the basis of self-serve computer configuration and ordering by customers. I would argue that these innovations also move out the PPF.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="861a" name="861a">As for the third form, digitizing an internal operation, in 2021 I only see it rarely as real strategy. The dominant mode is benchmarking and replicating, figuring out the best digital practice and doing it in order to move from a position inside the PPF out to the margin of the PPF that others have already established. Most such efforts don’t pass my strategy test: <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/is-the-opposite-of-your-choice-stupid-on-its-face-5b247ffd7f94" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/is-the-opposite-of-your-choice-stupid-on-its-face-5b247ffd7f94" target="_blank">the opposite is stupid on its face</a>. It isn’t a real choice for a Fortune 500 company to not have an ERM system because not having one is stupid. Having one won’t give you any kind of leg up, but it will help you stay in business.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8b74" name="8b74"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="90e8" name="90e8">If you are entrepreneurially minded, there is nothing better than trying to create a digital/self-serve business. There is more financing available to fund such start-ups than ever before. Think hard about a WTP that solves a real customer need and a paired HTW that solves it uniquely. If you are like Dropbox founder Drew Houston and you come up with a brilliant customer insight and a product that meets their need, you get to have half a billion users and become a multi-billionaire. It is worth trying if you have an idea that excites you.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="370e" name="370e">If you already in a business that isn’t digital/self-serve, ask how you can create a linked digital/self-serve business like FT.com, the App Store or Amazon Marketplace. Think about customers of your core service as the natural WTP and ask what digital/self-serve business could make their use of your core product more valuable. Your proprietary insights should come from your superior knowledge of your own customers. That is the best place to start.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3d95" name="3d95">If you can’t create a digital version of your product line, think about a clever way of creating a self-serve option for customers that would make their acquisition of your product a better experience. Don’t think first about saving costs — customers will hate you for that. Think about a better experience and if it saves costs: great.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="0c90" name="0c90">And don’t fall behind on digitizing everything that you can in your internal operations. It’s OK to be a fast follower — and hire consultants or recruit employees who have done it elsewhere. But don’t listen too much to the hype. It isn’t going to turn you into the next Facebook. It is predominantly a benchmark-and-replicate optimizing exercise. It is well worth the effort but calling it transformational or strategic is generally unhelpful hype.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

My 33rd Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights is on The Pervasive Analytical Blunder of Strategists. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="2927" name="2927">Modern Business Training</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="a849" name="a849">Modern business education trains all students to believe that good decisions are based on rigorous analysis of data, and strategy courses are certainly no exception. Managers who don’t make decisions based on rigorous analysis of data are presented as willfully incompetent managers. They know better. Yet they insist through sloth, arrogance, and/or ignorance in making bad decisions which, by definition, are those made on some other basis than the rigorous analysis of data. If you think I am overstating this, just think back to your most recent formal business training and you will realize that I am not.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="41b8" name="41b8">Whether students are taught statistics or analytical methodologies under names such as “decision analytics”, “decision making”, or “data analytics,” all those courses have standard statistical concepts underpinning them. Using varying levels of formality, these courses provide instruction on how students can infer from the analysis of data what is the data-based, and hence by definition, correct decision. And as I have argued <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/manipulation-of-quantities-appreciation-of-qualities-1b166ba9525b" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/manipulation-of-quantities-appreciation-of-qualities-1b166ba9525b" rel="noopener" target="_blank">earlier in this series</a>, when graduates enter the strategy consulting industry, they will find more of the same focus on the central importance of data-based decisions.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f517" name="f517">A critical tenet of the inferential methodology is that if a conclusion is to be drawn about a given universe, the sample analyzed must be representative of that universe. For example, to infer ‘what customers want,’ we need to collect data from a representative sample of said customers. If we collect data only from older customers or big city customers or male customers or west coast customers, we are taught that we can’t make an inference to the general universe of all customers from this unrepresentative or biased sample. Or if we want to know our average product costs across our network of factories, we can only determine that by analyzing costs from a representative set of factories, not from, say, our five biggest or newest factories.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ed54" name="ed54">So, a good decision is made on the basis of inference from the rigorous analysis of data drawn from a sample that is representative of the universe with respect to which we seek to make decisions. And in a bad one, either analysis isn’t done at all or it is based on a biased sample. That is the methodological doctrine of all modern business education. That means all fields of business from strategy to marketing to finance to operations to accounting — and even to human resources.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="ca4f" name="ca4f">The Inherent Data Limitation</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="9d4d" name="9d4d">What is generally not taught explicitly is that the inherent data limitation is that 100% of the world’s data is from one era: the past. Standing at any point in time, all data is from the past. Even if we have just finished running an experiment or collecting a sample, at that point in time, the actions giving rise to our data have happened already. There is no data about the future — ever. Thus, for every single analysis that modern business education tells you that you must do to be a good (not bad) manager, you are restricted strictly to a pool of data that is in the past as of the time that you analyze and draw inferences from it. There is no way around this limitation: it is an inherent part of the thing we call life!</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="65dc" name="65dc">When This Data Limitation is Not a Problem</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="9a69" name="9a69">There is a class of circumstances in which this data limitation poses no challenge to assembling a representative sample. If we can say that the pool of data from the past is indistinguishable from the pool of data from the future, then we can be confident that the data from the past is completely representative not only of the past but the future as well. For example, if I hold a ball in my hand, palm downward, and release it 100 times, it will fall to the ground every time. Since balls have been dropping for time immemorial and there seems like little chance that the force of gravity is going to change any time soon, it is reasonable to assume that the 100 ball-drop sample is representative of the universe of ball-drops, including those that will happen in the future.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5829" name="5829">Aristotle, the 4th century B.C. Greek philosopher who invented the concept of data analytics, called this kind of ball-drop scenario “<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/management-is-much-more-than-a-science" href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/management-is-much-more-than-a-science" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the part of the world where things cannot be other than they are</a>.” Gravity will always operate the way it has and does. Hence balls will always drop the way they have done. Hence the use of data from the past is representative of the future and fully usable to make inferences about the future on which to make decisions. If you prefer a more recent theorist, the Santa Fe Institute’s <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/complexity/id1482984603?i=1000494775884" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/complexity/id1482984603?i=1000494775884" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Wolpert makes the same point</a>, calling this as the math part of the world, the part governed by immutable laws where we can make confident, data-based predictions about the future.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="6f3f" name="6f3f">When This Data Limitation is a Giant Problem</h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="c7e0" name="c7e0">Let’s switch from ball dropping to smartphone usage. If we did a survey of smartphone usage patterns in 1999, we would find that customers didn’t use smartphones at all. That was for a good reason: the first commercially successful smartphone was launched by BlackBerry a year later in 2000. If we broaden the definition to Personal Digital Assistants (PDA), <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043961/" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043961/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the installed base in 1999 was well under 10 million</a>. Analyzing that in 1999, we might conclude that the future usage of intelligent handheld devices like PDAs and smartphones would be modest. Perhaps we would extrapolate the growth in the data leading up to 1999 and come up with, say, a couple of hundred million by 2020. But no analysis of 1999 data could get the analyst to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-01-gartner-forecasts-global-devices-installed-base-to-reach-6-2-billion-units-in-2021" href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-01-gartner-forecasts-global-devices-installed-base-to-reach-6-2-billion-units-in-2021" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an installed base of 4.4 billion a mere 20 years later</a>.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e4ee" name="e4ee">Human use of smartphones is squarely in Aristotle’s other category: “the part of the world where things can be other than they are.” In the past 20 years, we humans have dramatically changed the way we live and operate based on the smartphone. In 2000, only a miniscule fraction of humanity knew what a smartphone was. Now half of humanity owns and intensively uses one. Wolpert calls this the world of physics — where messy, real things interact in unpredictable ways. To generalize further, it is the part of the world in which humans interact with one another and try to get things done. This part of the world forever changes.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f871" name="f871">In this part of the world, a sample drawn from the past is utterly unrepresentative of the universe including the future. And it is particularly problematic in being unrepresentative in ways we cannot know until after the fact. It is not even that we can say “Oh we sampled men only and probably women are more likely to be users of the product/service in question than men, so let’s adjust our analytical estimate upward a bit.” In this case, we have no idea of the nature, direction, or magnitude of the flaw — until the future unfolds.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="f0a1" name="f0a1"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">The Pervasive Analytical Error</strong></h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="d7b9" name="d7b9">Despite Aristotle’s very specific warning to never use analytical inference in the part of the world where things can be other than they are, and Wolpert’s modern restatement of the warning, not only does the business world routinely violate the principles of statistics and sense to do exactly that, but the learned institutions of business education also teach the error-filled practice with enthusiasm bordering on fanaticism. It flat out disables otherwise intelligent men and women. It deludes them into thinking that their choices are valid when they are, in fact, designed to be fallacious blunders.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1319" name="1319">And the problem is getting worse not better. Data analytics is all the rage. Stunningly enough, “people analytics” is a big field. The implicit presumption behind people analytics is that people are part of the world in which things cannot be other than they are. I.e., people cannot and will not change. That is an insane assumption that is inconsistent with thousands of years of, well, data.</p><h4 class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p" id="7bbe" name="7bbe"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></h4><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4" id="195e" name="195e">As a strategist, before you make any decision based on data analysis of any sort, you must ask yourself one simple question: Am I willing to assume that the future will be identical to the past? If the answer is yes, then do what the analysis tells you to do. If the answer is no, then DO NOT USE THE ANALYSIS. You have no idea how the future will change the inferences you make based on the analysis. It doesn’t matter what you have been taught. In this situation — which is the vast majority of cases for a strategist — what you have been taught is dangerous to the health of you and your business. All it will do is make you confident about your analytical delusion. In reality, your data analysis has the same level of rigor as bloodletting or application of leeches.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="421b" name="421b">In this part of the world, heed Aristotle’s advice. Imagine possibilities and choose the one for which the most compelling argument can be made. Analysis is logic to which data is applied. For the future, there is no data, so the degree to which your logic is more compelling than competing logic (or not) is the key question.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bb2b" name="bb2b">The best way to test your logic is by turning the future into the past. The data problem with the next six months is that there is no data yet about the next six months. The good thing about the next six months is that in six months, it will be a part of the past. That is why prototyping is the true friend of effective strategists. Since you have no data about the future, take the logic that you feel is most compelling and put it to a test — the most thorough test that is easily affordable — and collect data from that test. If you do this iteratively, you will get more and more insight into a proposition that is more and more compelling — though never ‘proven.’</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="0b1a" name="0b1a">That is a more rigorous way to do strategy than the analytical method you have been taught if you have had formal strategy training. If you haven’t; you are in luck! You don’t have to unlearn destructive and delusional practices.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Does it work for start-ups? Does it work for non-profits? Does it work for functions? (Yes, yes, and yes) But only once have I been asked about Playing to Win for an individual, an insightful question with a broadly applicable answer. So, I decided to dedicate my 34th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) to Your Personal Playing to Win Strategy. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="43d2" name="43d2"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Fallacies about the Modern Job</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="646e" name="646e">There have been vast changes in the structure of work over the past century. A century ago, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2012/02/the-us-needs-to-make-more-jobs" href="https://hbr.org/2012/02/the-us-needs-to-make-more-jobs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">nearly 90% of jobs were of a routine nature</a> involving very little room for independent decision-making. These were jobs mainly in the manufacturing and resource sectors — working in a factory or a mine, performing the identical set of clearly prescribed tasks each day. This kind of job hasn’t gone away, although now it is much more likely to be in a service operation — like retailing, health care or fulfillment/customer service. The striking growth has been in jobs requiring a high-degree of independent judgment and decision-making, what <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/CR-07-2015-0069/full/html" href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/CR-07-2015-0069/full/html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my colleague Richard Florida and I term creativity-intensive jobs</a>. They have tripled to almost 40% of jobs and rising. These include professional jobs (lawyers, doctors, accountants, etc.), educational jobs (teachers, scientists, professors), artistic jobs, and all managerial jobs, among others.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7327" name="7327">For better and worse, many features of job structuring have been maintained from that earlier world. From the world of routine jobs has come full-time jobs with descriptions that primarily detail the activities the incumbent engages in on a consistent basis — largely as if the incumbent held down the door-handle station on the auto assembly line or was a pick-axe wielder in a coal mine.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6c15" name="6c15">This produces two consistent anachronisms for the modern creativity-intensive job. If you read any modern job description, it will specify lots of things the incumbent rarely if ever does. And it treats the job as if you do the same elements of the job all the time. Both are holdovers from a time where both of those features were accurate. They aren’t anymore — especially in the business realm. In the modern business world, the incumbent engages in <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2013/10/rethinking-the-decision-factory" href="https://hbr.org/2013/10/rethinking-the-decision-factory" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a set of projects that come and go and change constantly</a>. And this is the case especially as you advance in your career.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d686" name="d686"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Your Personal Playing to Win Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9a46" name="9a46">Because the modern creativity-intensive job description is more of a catch-all housing for a portfolio of potential projects, there is great scope for strategy choice about how you perform your job. (I will return to argue that it isn’t choiceless for routine-intensive jobs, but I don’t want to overstate the more challenging environment in those jobs.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0794" name="0794">Whether you are a lower-level Brand Manager or a higher-level VP-Marketing, there will be lots of things in your job description that you do occasionally or not at all. It might say “design advertising,” which you may well do once a year or “oversee product launches,” which you may do once every few years. I often argue that if you were rigorously audited on whether you do on a regular basis all the things in your job description, you would be fired! As a result, there is enormous room within the vast expanses of your job description to make Where-to-Play (WTP) choices. You could focus on some things within the array more than other things.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dd57" name="dd57">Your first reaction might be to think it your boss’s job to define your WTP. And technically it is. But in my experience, most bosses are distracted by the various facets of their own job and/or not very good at defining your WTP. They will give you projects, but not think systematically about your whole job. Think of your boss as you would a distribution channel, laying between you and the end-customer. If you pay attention only to the distribution channel, it may lead you astray. If you ignore the distribution channel and pay attention only to the end-customer, the distribution channel may block your access to the end-customers (or the moral equivalent in this case: fire you). Your WTP strategy choice task is to determine how to best apportion your resources to help your boss serve your joint customers the best you can. That is a big and important choice. For example, it is to spend disproportionately on understanding existing customers or on finding new customer segments or supporting the sales force, or supporting the R&amp;D efforts on your product line, etc.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6687" name="6687">But it is not an independent choice. It must be tied to your How-to-Win (HTW) choice. You need to think about how across the various potential value adding WTPs that you will be able to produce the highest level of value given your particular set of Capabilities. You will naturally be better at some tasks than others and part of your strategy choice is how to select a HTW that is nicely matched to your potential WTP.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7a5b" name="7a5b">But as with all strategy, the WTP/HTW combination doesn’t have to be restricted only to one possible with current Capabilities. It can necessitate that you to build the necessary Capabilities to Win where you have chosen to Play. And that takes Management System choices that guide you in building the Capabilities that enable you to Win where you want to play. That might be a personal Management System that ensures you are out with customers enough, taking finance classes, spending time with mentors, building a network, and so on. Those won’t necessarily happen without a Management System for doing so.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3999" name="3999">The final check across the boxes of the Strategy Choice Cascade is the Winning Aspiration. Does this set of WTP/HTW/Capabilities/Management Systems choices produce an outcome that is exciting and motivational for you? If it doesn’t, it is time to rework the set of choices. If it does, then that is your personal Playing to Win strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d723" name="d723">What about those holding the routine-intensive jobs? To be sure, it is tougher to fashion a personal PTW strategy. I wish that 100% of jobs currently involved a high level of independent judgment and decision-making as a matter of course. But it is going to take a long while to get from 40% of jobs to anywhere near 100%. However, I would still argue that thinking about WTP/HTW in important. There is still a range of optionality across which you can figure out where to spend time versus not.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dbd1" name="dbd1">I will always remember a story my father, who picked peaches as a summer job growing up, told me about the farmer who hired him as one of the handful of other teenagers to pick peaches at his peach farm during the picking season. Prior to the first day, the farmer gathered the boys around and gave them a choice: “The picking day is eight hours. All the other farms around pick from 9 am to 5 pm because the pickers can sleep in and by 9 am the morning dew has dried so that you don’t get your pants soaked. However, I find that the heat by 2 pm is brutal and you are already tired, so the picking isn’t either enjoyable or productive. So, I start at 6 am. The bad news is you have to get up really early and the dew is still heavy from 6 am to nearly 9 am. But you are done by 2 pm, in time for a nice swim. I won’t impose. I will leave you to vote on which to do starting tomorrow am.” My dad and his cohort chose the early start — a great WTP/HTW choice for a very routine job. Strategy is choice and there are always better ones and worse ones.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8db7" name="8db7"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="60fe" name="60fe">I suspect the response from some readers will be: “Isn’t this pretty calculating and even bordering on conniving? Shouldn’t you just do your job?” As I have pointed out <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-is-what-you-do-not-what-you-say-a6e483840557" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-is-what-you-do-not-what-you-say-a6e483840557" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously in this series</a>, every organization has a strategy — even if that happens to be an organization of one. It is what you do, not what you say. Your strategy is the choices that you are making. So, you have a strategy for your job. The only choice is whether to make the choices consciously and thoughtfully or let them happen implicitly and incrementally. And if it seems I am framing this as an obvious choice, I am.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3087" name="3087">It is important that the PTW choices be led by your Winning Aspiration. Never lose sight of that. The only good WTP/HTW choice is one that is consistent with your Winning Aspiration. Just as every corporation needs to define its Winning Aspiration for itself, yours isn’t defined by someone else but by you. That is why it isn’t conniving. It is aspirational. You need to think carefully about the WTP/HTW choices that will best fulfill your Winning Aspiration and will guide you in choosing the Capabilities in which you invest through both formal education and practical experience, and the Management System choices that will help keep your capability-building on track.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="75dc" name="75dc">Others may be asking: “How can I know that my personal WTP/HTW is correct?” You can’t. No strategy can ever be certainly correct, whether for a person or a business. It is always a judgment call that has two main purposes. First, it is to shorten your odds of success. Careful thinking on strategy can increase the probability of success and clip off the tail of avoidable catastrophes (<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://fortune.com/2021/05/17/atts-warner-media-merger-hbo-warner-bros-discovery/" href="https://fortune.com/2021/05/17/atts-warner-media-merger-hbo-warner-bros-discovery/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like this one</a>!) Second, it is to enable speedy course correction. I argue that when choosing strategy,<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2010/05/the-day-i-discovered-the-most.html" href="https://hbr.org/2010/05/the-day-i-discovered-the-most.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> the most important question is What Would Have to be True</a>. An important use of WWHTBT is that after you have decided on your strategy, you can post your WWHTBT in front of you at your desk and check it every morning. If the important things that would have to be true for your personal strategy to succeed aren’t looking particularly true, then you have an early warning that it is time to course correct and think ahead about your next set of strategy choices.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Still, I get questions, lots of good questions, on the relationship between strategy and planning. So, my 35thPTW/PI is on From Strategy to Planning: What is Next After Strategy? (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a52f" name="a52f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Going Back to First Principles</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8af3" name="8af3">The most typical question I get asked is: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">After I have finished my strategy, what do I have to do to convert it into action? </em>It is a good question, the answer to which is not entirely intuitive. Plus, my views don’t exactly follow the standard thinking out in the world of strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6814" name="6814">For that reason, I will go back to first principles to build the logic. It starts with the recognition that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/strategy-as-problem-solving-5c6fb9291d87" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/strategy-as-problem-solving-5c6fb9291d87" target="_blank">strategy is a problem-solving tool</a>. Its job is to overcome a gap between the outcomes we experience and the aspirations we hold. That gap is a product of the current set of choices that has guided our actions up to this point in time, regardless of whether that set of choices evolved implicitly over time or was the product of an explicit strategy effort.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d5a4" name="d5a4">A new strategy seeks to close the gap by means of a new set of choices. By definition, this needs to be a different set of choices, or it would fail entirely to close the gap that has been produced by the current set of choices. Because strategy is <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-is-what-you-do-not-what-you-say-a6e483840557" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-is-what-you-do-not-what-you-say-a6e483840557" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what you do not what you say</a>, that different set of choices need to be manifested in different actions. Otherwise, there is no reason to believe that there will be any progress toward eliminating the gap. To summarize, strategy needs to produce a new set of choices that translates into action and, by doing so, eliminates the problematic gap produced by the existing set of choices.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d677" name="d677">The heart of strategy is <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/on-the-inseparability-of-where-to-play-and-how-to-win-181c2ea5c463" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/on-the-inseparability-of-where-to-play-and-how-to-win-181c2ea5c463" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the matched pair of Where-to-Play and How-to-Win</a> (WTP/HTW) choices. There will be no elimination of the problematic gap between outcomes and aspirations without a change in the WTP/HTW pair. You can change one, the other, or both. But if you don’t change them, you haven’t changed your strategy choice.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2faf" name="2faf">Note that it is a real change to move from an espoused strategy that you don’t enact to the enaction of the previously espoused strategy. That is, if a company claims its existing strategy is to win in a particular place but it hasn’t invested in the Must-Have Capabilities (MHC) necessary to win and/or doesn’t have the Enabling Management Systems (EMS) that build and maintain those MHC, then its existing real strategy is to play, not to win. It would be a strategy change to have a HTW that is now backed with MHC/EMS that facilitate actual winning.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d46d" name="d46d">MHC and EMS play a central and critical role in bring strategy to life. For a new WTP/HTW choice to bring about real change, MHC and/or EMS must change. Otherwise, the purported change will be an espoused change, a theoretical WTP/HTW, not a real change in strategy, and the gap won’t be diminished.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="88e4" name="88e4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">An Illustration with the Burberry Turnaround</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d450" name="d450">Let me illustrate the tie between WTP/HTW and MHC/EMS with Angela Ahrendts’ epic turnaround of the venerable but fading luxury fashion brand Burberry during her time as CEO (2006–2014). Her Winning Aspiration (WA) to restore the glory of a great British luxury brand necessitated a major upgrade to its strategy, so she dramatically altered both its WTP and HTW. The WTP shifted from the traditional older luxury fashion demographic to focus on millennials. It also shifted from dedicating resources indiscriminately across a broad array of fashion and accessories to applying disproportionate focus on its core signature product: the trench coat. The HTW featured a shift edgier luxury fashion, delivered in a more digitally oriented manner — a HTW nicely matched with its WTP!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a04a" name="a04a">While that was a bold WTP/HTW shift, it would have meant nothing without changing MHC and EMS. She needed an enhanced MHC to design fashion apparel that would appeal to the millennial demographic while being true to the Burberry brand heritage. And she needed a consistency to that brand image, which had been fractured globally by having numerous country design leaders each doing their own things. To build MHC to deliver edgier fashion, she elevated a (then) young but brilliant designer named Christopher Bailey to Chief Creative Officer. She also changed EMS by appointing Bailey the global “brand czar.” Design directors in individual countries could no longer make design decisions independently; decisions had to be coordinated through the office of the brand czar.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9225" name="9225">She also needed to dramatically enhance on-line capabilities and that meant changing the EMS for resource allocation to dedicate dramatically more resources to on-line initiatives. She needed to refocus retail sales on the trench coat and marketing leadership on marketing to millennials.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4f81" name="4f81">Ahrendts could make some of these MHC/EMS changes and enhancements alone — such as the elevation of Bailey and broadening of his role — but for most of them, the key was in carefully <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/strategic-choice-chartering-3d56d8962ec3" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/strategic-choice-chartering-3d56d8962ec3" target="_blank">chartering the choices</a> that her next level of subordinates needed to make. Ahrendts couldn’t (and shouldn’t) directly make the choices that would make the fashion edgier, create a breakthrough online presence, or ensure an intensive focus on the trench coat. But she could, for example, explain to Bailey what output she was looking for in the first two, in addition to changing the EMS for branding by making him the brand czar and enhancing the potential for capability-building by upping the allowable investment level in digital.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="00f9" name="00f9">It was up to Bailey to make the key strategic choices that produced edgier fashion and the finest online presence in luxury. On the former, his HTW choice involved leveraging the youth within the company, which he did with a change to the EMS that built the edgier MHC. He created an Innovation Council that uniquely drew from all levels of the company design community to generate edgier fashion ideas and paired it with a more senior Executive Council charged with making business sense of those ideas and bringing them to fruition.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0fa2" name="0fa2">In digital, Bailey’s WTP choice was to drive deeply into social media before it became the obvious thing to do. Its interactive Art of the Trench website became legendary for being the place that Burberry trench coat customers could post photos of themselves in their beloved coats and it made Burberry the #1 luxury brand on Facebook and Twitter.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3512" name="3512">Elsewhere, retail sales leadership shifted the incentive compensation EMS to make sure that in-store salespeople no longer had the biggest incentive to sell polo shirts but rather to sell trench coats. And marketing leadership built its MHC by <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/lbs-case-study/burberry-social-media-initiative/story/191422.html" href="https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/lbs-case-study/burberry-social-media-initiative/story/191422.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spending 60% of its of marketing budget on digital</a>.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b7fd" name="b7fd"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Elements of What Comes After Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4043" name="4043">What then is the planning activity that follows your strategy choice? You should create a plan comprised of three elements. First, it should specify and communicate the choices that you personally will be making and the timing of those choices (for example, elevating Bailey and appointing him brand czar). Second, it should specify the choices you will be chartering (for example, asking the head of retail operations to find a way to alter the EMS for in-store commissions to result in the necessary focus on selling trench coats). Third, it should specify your own EMS for following up on the chartered choices to make sure they are being effected and made consistently with your choices. This is why I argue that the wise and thorough <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/strategic-choice-chartering-3d56d8962ec3" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/strategic-choice-chartering-3d56d8962ec3" target="_blank">chartering of strategy choices</a> is one of the highest-leverage activities for any executive. Ahrendts achieved legendary success as CEO of Burberry by making and communicating great strategy choices, chartering strategy choices wisely, and following up to make sure those choices were made and made consistently.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6093" name="6093">The implication of this approach is that an organization doesn’t have (or at least shouldn’t have) one humongous plan. It has many — in fact one for every manager. Attempting to smoosh them together into one interminably long document creates no value — except to bureaucrats. And trying to manage such a plan centrally is a key reason why there are such problems turning strategy into timely action. Every manager should have a plan. And that manager’s supervisor should make sure that the choices she chartered to that manager are being made. And that manager should be making sure that the choices he chartered to his subordinates are being made — and so on throughout the organization.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="da8c" name="da8c"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0e7b" name="0e7b">Regardless of where you are in your organization from CEO to first-level manager, you have three tasks. First, you need to make and communicate your strategy choices (WA, WTP, HTW, MHC &amp; EMS). If your superior is doing her job properly (and you aren’t the CEO), your superior will have chartered you with making choices that are consistent with and reinforcing of her choices. If not, and sadly this will be the case more often than not, you will need to reverse-engineer her choices and charter your own choices on that basis. Second, you need to charter the choices of your subordinates. Each one needs to know what choices you are counting on him to make that will enable your strategy. Third, you need to develop and deploy a personal system for you to make sure those subordinates make their choices in a timely manner. This could involve helping them make the choices you need them to make, considering possibilities for choices that they present to you, ratifying their choices, etc.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="a0a0" name="a0a0">If you do this well with your subordinates, they will follow your model and do it with their subordinates. And that in turn will create a culture of planning that isn’t bureaucratic and controlling but rather decentralized but coordinated, and empowering.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Martin, 2021</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="42fe" name="42fe">I frequently get asked a question about questions: What questions should I ask when I am reviewing a strategy? Because of that consistent interest, I am dedicating my 36th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece to Asking Great Strategy Questions. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2dbb" name="2dbb"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Three Categories of Questions</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="442a" name="442a">I am often asked to evaluate strategies, whether for clients, students, or friends. Rather than focus primarily on whether the strategy is good or bad, I focus on asking questions with the intention of guiding the authors toward their goal of creating great strategies. To provide that help, I ask strategy questions in three broad categories: logic, fit, and distinctiveness. The questions aren’t entirely distinct from one another. There is overlap. But I think that a bit of overlap isn’t a problem if it ensures I don’t miss anything.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8fc8" name="8fc8">With no further ado, here are questions to help hone and refine any strategy…</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2859" name="2859"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Logic</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e9ad" name="e9ad">I typically start by exploring the logical structure of the overall cascade of choices before diving into narrower areas of questioning. The key question for testing the logic of a strategy is what I refer to as <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-time-a357865c1763" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-time-a357865c1763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the most important question in strategy</a>: what would have to be true (WWHTBT) for this to be a robust strategy? The most important WWHTBT questions pertain to the logic of customers, capabilities, costs, and competitors.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a6d0" name="a6d0">To be successful, all strategies need to appeal to the needs and desires of customers, so I want to understand and evaluate what the strategy assumes about those needs and desires. Hence, I ask what does the strategy assume would have to be true about about customer needs for it to be an effective strategy? Does, for example, the strategy assume they care most about breadth of product line or speed of delivery or taste, etc. If there is both a distribution channel and an end-customer to consider, I would ask the WWBTBT question relative to each.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e515" name="e515">To be successful, a strategy needs to be backed by capabilities that meet the needs of customers. So, I ask what does the strategy assume would have to be true about our capabilities for the strategy to be effective? For example, does it assume that our capabilities would have to be equal to competitors or superior to theirs?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cec5" name="cec5">To be successful, a strategy needs to be underpinned by a cost structure incurred to meet the needs of customers. So, I ask what does the strategy assume would have to be true about our cost structure for the chosen strategy to be effective? For example, does it assume our costs would have to be equal to competitors or superior to theirs?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cd16" name="cd16">To be successful, a strategy needs to be robust in the face of reactions by competitors. So, I ask what does the strategy assume would have to be true about competitor response to our strategy for the chosen strategy to be effective? Is the assumption that they will respond but their response will be ineffective in undermining the effectiveness of our strategy? Or is the assumption that they won’t respond to our strategy?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="eb0c" name="eb0c">I accumulate the WWHTBT assumptions across these four categories to ask the follow-up strategy question: Of all the WWHTBT assumptions, which are the ones that are so heroic that I would not be willing to make a bet on them if it was my strategy? And for those heroic assumptions, what tweaks could be made to the choices across the choice cascade that would result in WWHTBT assumptions that are more prudent?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="395d" name="395d">Together, these WWHTBT questions help to hone and refine the overarching strategic logic of the choices across the strategy choice cascade.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5f41" name="5f41"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Fit</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f5be" name="f5be">I also pay attention to and question the degree to which the individual elements of the choice cascade fit together as elegantly as they can.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ff51" name="ff51">For the proposed How-to-Win (HTW), is the Where-to-Play (WTP) as perfect as possible? If we narrowed our WTP, would we be better able to focus our resources to win more decisively? What we might contemplate in terms of different narrowing moves: segments served, product/service varieties, vertical scope, or geographies? If instead, we broadened our WTP along one or more of those dimensions, could we be better able to generate the resources to win more decisively? If so, with what broadening move?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="efe7" name="efe7">For our proposed HTW, do we currently possess the required Must-Have Capabilities (MHC)? If not, can we build them quickly enough for the strategy to work? If that is unlikely, how might we modify the HTW in a way that better aligns the MHC with our current (or readily realizable) capabilities.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="80f3" name="80f3">For our proposed MHC, do we currently possess the Enabling Management Systems (EMS) to build and maintain them? If not, can we create EMS quickly enough to build the MHC for the strategy to work? If that is unlikely, how might we modify the HTW in a way that requires only MHC for which we have or can create the EMS that will build and maintain them.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1971" name="1971">Finally, does our Winning Aspiration (WA) fit in a way that provides positive guidance for our WTP/HTW/MHC/EMS choices and inspires customers, employees, channel partners and suppliers to support our strategy? If not, in what ways could we adjust the WA to better fit with and reinforce the other four choices?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cbb5" name="cbb5">Together, these fit questions help ensure that the choices in each of the five areas not only avert contradictions, but they also fit with one another and reinforce the strength of each.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="df5e" name="df5e"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Distinctiveness</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6e03" name="6e03">The final area is distinctiveness. A strategy could do a good job of exhibiting fit and logical coherence, but not have sufficient distinctiveness to produce great results. That is where the question of whether <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/is-the-opposite-of-your-choice-stupid-on-its-face-5b247ffd7f94" href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/is-the-opposite-of-your-choice-stupid-on-its-face-5b247ffd7f94" target="_blank">the opposite is stupid on its face</a> comes in. If the opposite of one of your ‘strategy choices’ (e.g., WTP or HTW) is stupid on its face, then every competitor will make the same choice and your choice will provide no distinctiveness whatsoever. I remember facilitating a strategy session for a Swiss private bank once and it made what it thought to be a strategic WTP choice: to serve wealthy customers. I pointed out that for a private bank to serve customers lacking wealth was stupid on its face so that its choice would be identical to every other private bank. But they insisted — and unsurprisingly, that ‘choice’ didn’t produce the wonderful outcomes that they expected.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e237" name="e237">If the opposite not only is not stupid on its face, but in fact another competitor is doing the opposite (or something distinctly different), then the choice has the promise of distinctiveness. It must pass the other tests above, but at least it has a chance of resulting in a winning strategy. By asking whether the opposite is stupid on its face, you can push the choice to one that is more distinctive from the common choice of competitors.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e78a" name="e78a">The other key distinctiveness question is <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/distinguishing-how-to-win-from-capabilities-in-your-strategy-choice-fd190484ccea" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/distinguishing-how-to-win-from-capabilities-in-your-strategy-choice-fd190484ccea" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the can’t/won’t test</a>. That is, what leads us to believe that a key competitor either can’t or won’t replicate our set of strategy choices and therefore eliminate our distinctiveness? Typically, they <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t</em> because they don’t have our MHC and EMS, and it would be difficult for them to build them. Typically, they <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">won’t</em>because they prefer playing in their current WTP/HTW combination. If one of those two is the answer to the can’t/won’t question, the strategy is likely to be sufficiently distinctive so that if it has strong logic and fit it is likely to be an excellent strategy. If the answer to the can’t/won’t question is that they can/will, then the strategy needs more work on distinctiveness.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b3c9" name="b3c9">Together, the is the opposite stupid question and can’t/won’t test will help alert you to the need to tweak your strategy choice to enhance its distinctiveness.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ece0" name="ece0"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="312e" name="312e">It is important to remember that strategy is not an exercise in perfection — getting ‘the right strategy’ that is sure to succeed. Given that nobody knows the future until it happens, the best that a set of strategy choices can do for you is improve your odds of success. You can improve those odds by evaluating your strategy and tweaking it to improve the logic, fit and distinctiveness. I think of that exercise as lopping off the left tail of the distribution of likely outcomes. If you can avoid choices that aren’t logically sound, don’t have the internal consistency of good fit, and aren’t even aiming at distinctiveness, then you will avoid strategies that are designed to fail. And by lopping off that tail, you improve the likely value of your strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="7d06" name="7d06">One way to perform the evaluation is for you to ask the above questions of logic, fit and distinctiveness. An even better way is to get outside your own head and ask someone else to quiz you on your strategy. As is always the case, they will see things you don’t see and provide avenues for you to strengthen the logic, tighten the fit, and accentuate the distinctiveness of your strategy.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

By and large, the questions aren’t at all neutral. The tend to be phrased as: Isn’t it really important to have pay for performance to get your strategy executed? It isn’t, as I will discuss in my 37th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece: It’s Time to Accept that Pay for Performance Doesn’t Work. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4bff" name="4bff"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">An Article of Faith</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="51aa" name="51aa">We have long taken it as an article of faith that if you want performance against your strategy, you have to pay for it by way of incentive compensation. Hundreds of millions of person-hours get spent every year designing Pay for Performance (PfP) systems, then arguing about the design, then measuring performance against PfP systems, then arguing about the measurement, then paying out against the PfP system, and then arguing about the payouts. And then more hours the next year on redesigning PfP because it never seems to work out the way we thought it would.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fe86" name="fe86">The logical assumption is that PfP just has to work. Employees will give greater effort if the results of that effort are tied directly to greater levels of compensation, right? That is the way humans work, isn’t it? And it would be so embarrassing if all those person-hours spent designing and operating PfP systems were in vain, we don’t even want to contemplate that. No: if you want to make sure that the things in your strategy actually get done, you have to provide strong incentives through PfP!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="231a" name="231a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">My Crumbling Faith</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="85cd" name="85cd">My faith in PfP began to crumble during my work with Harvard Business School (HBS) professor Michael Jensen in the mid-1990s. As the father of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v3y1976i4p305-360.html" href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v3y1976i4p305-360.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">agency theory</a>, Mike had important views on how managers responded to incentives, and I wanted to integrate those thoughts into my approach to strategy. As part of that work, he introduced me to one of the most interesting articles I have ever read, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/221011" href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/221011" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Quota Restriction and Goldbricking in a Machine Shop</em></a>, published in 1952. It was written by a young scholar named Donald Roy who went to work for 11 months as a drill operator in a shop that machined steel parts as a hands-on way to collect data for his PhD dissertation — if that isn’t commitment, I don’t know what is!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6383" name="6383">Michael liked the article because it demonstrated clearly that if you put kinks in the curve that related performance to compensation, you will drive performance to the kinks as is illustrated in the chart above, which shows a vast majority of the outcomes to be clustered around two kinks. One is around the least work you can get away with to earn minimum daily day without being fired (24% of observations). The other (47%) is around the highest pay you can earn without risking being the worker that caused the ‘standards department’ to rerate the task to make it less lucrative, thus becoming the least popular worker in the shop.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9932" name="9932">My central takeaway was somewhat different than Michael’s. In the article, Roy estimated that workers were putting in four or few hours of real work per eight-hour shift to optimally game the system for their own benefit by alternatively not working at all and earning the floor pay when the machining jobs were particularly tough (“stinkers”) and working slowly to earn the maximum safe pay when jobswere particularly easy (“gravy”). The productivity cost to the shop was astronomical. Plus, it created an environment of cheating and covering up, an environment into which Roy was indoctrinated the minute he showed up.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2b4c" name="2b4c">Then in 2001, I reconnected with one of my HBS professors, Malcolm Salter, to work on a project. One day as we were working together, he casually mentioned that there had never been a rigorous study which demonstrated a beneficial impact of monetary incentive compensation on organizational performance. I pushed back but he was adamant. I decided to check with him 20 years later and in an email response to me last week he said: “Amazingly, I think my earlier comment on the lack of rigorous research on a positive relationship between financial incentives and organizational performance still stands.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="00f1" name="00f1">A dozen years ago, an article in the 2009 Review of Economic Studies, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/76/2/451/1594205" href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/76/2/451/1594205" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Large Stakes and Big Mistakes</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">, </em>provided the coup de grace to my crumbling faith. Dan Ariely, Uri Gneezy, George Loewenstein, and Nina Mazar demonstrated that for tasks involving the brain (e.g., problem-solving), performance declined as incentive compensation increased. It turns out that incentive compensation only produces better performance in tasks that are primarily physical in nature (e.g., repetitive button-pushing) — not the staple of the modern manager’s work agenda.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="82e3" name="82e3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pay for Performance Won’t Help Bring Your Strategy to Fruition</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="41f8" name="41f8">PfP simply is not a useful tool. The problems with it overwhelm the good that it hypothetically produces. There are five big problems that in combination are just too big for PfP to overcome.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8893" name="8893">First, PfP is an extremely blunt instrument. Roy’s machine shop illustrates it well. The incentive doesn’t skew behavior a bit: it skews behavior immensely. Almost half of the total observations are in a narrow band around the rerate line. And it isn’t even a management-defined line. It is the guesstimate of workers as to at what point management might take deleterious action. Management isn’t even in control of the impacts of its own system. Wells Fargo provides yet another object lesson in bluntness. Workers did exactly what management wanted and gave them incentive compensation for: they opened accounts. Management just didn’t know the extent to which workers were willing to go to do exactly for what they were paying. And that cost Wells Fargo billions and worse yet, its reputation.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="33b4" name="33b4">Second, there is evidence that when it comes to tasks of the mind, monetary incentive compensation creates choking behavior of the sort described in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Large Stakes and Big Mistakes</em>, rather than the desired superior performance</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7b6b" name="7b6b">Third, it is really hard to coordinate the effects of incentives across entire organizations. At an individual worker level, incentive compensation might produce more of what the designers want, and not too much, but that is difficult to accomplish without creating problems elsewhere. Sales may well have an incentive to do something that makes life miserable for operations. Finance to do something that makes life miserable for customer service. And the conflicts that inevitably arise drown out any positive impact.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f1dd" name="f1dd">Fourth, the gaming is without limit. Roy’s machine shop is a poignant example. For every worker, half their day was spent doing nothing productive. Tanking a whole year to reset the budget at an easy level. Stuffing the distribution channel to make the quarter. Chopping advertising spending to jack up this year’s profitability. Diluting the ingredients in the termite spray at the end of the year to make budget — yup, freely admitted to me by field staff at a former client. Opening accounts that customers never approved. Recognize that there is no limit!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c8e7" name="c8e7">Fifth, you can’t fool customers. They figure out that they have a big target on their backs. Your incentive compensation ranks far above their satisfaction. They figure out that are merely a means to your end. But of course, they aren’t powerless. They know that you are trying to make budget to get your bonus and they can wrap you around their finger as year-end approaches. Monetary incentive compensation is toxic for customers. And that is even if it is about customer satisfaction scores. With two of my last three car purchases, the salesperson pleaded with me to give him a perfect satisfaction score to help with his compensation — resulting in me never intending to purchase a car from their companies (Lexus and Range Rover) again — great cars, but terrible customer experience thanks to monetary incentive compensation.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e548" name="e548"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Reward in Other Ways</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c027" name="c027">If you really want to encourage the behaviors that your strategy requires, reward it in other ways. Four Seasons Hotels &amp; Resorts treats its employees the way it wants its guests to be treated. Employees get great eating and changing facilities, are treated with respect, are given high compensation, and are provided the best training and career development in the industry, and guess what, they treat guests the way they are treated, which results in Four Seasons earning the highest ratings for guest service in the industry.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6007" name="6007">Almost all the leading New York corporate law firms pay their partners explicitly for performance measured by a combination of hours billed and clients acquired. But one of the very best and most respected, Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, has zero PfP. Every year, partners get paid the same as every other partner of equal partnership tenure, what is called lock-step compensation or most commonly the Cravath scale. It is because the Cravath strategy holds that cooperation among partners is the key to the best client service, which in turn is the key to keeping existing clients and earning new ones. And firm success combined with a pleasant and cooperative work environment is what will attract and retain the best partners. Law firm PfP works entirely against such a strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2892" name="2892">Both the Four Seasons and Cravath approaches represent Enabling Management Systems designed to build and maintain the Must-Have Capabilities that enable the How to Win in the chosen Where to Play. They illustrate the productive way to tie compensation to strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="349c" name="349c"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="78f3" name="78f3">Don’t accept PfP as an article of faith. If you are on the receiving end, recognize the dangers and the downsides. You will have to determine your own stopping mechanism; the point at which doing more would earn you more incentive compensation, but you know it is bad for the business long-term. In addition, you will have to show self-control on gaming. The moment you start gaming the system, you create a schism between you and management. While they deserve it for being delusional, the price is that it will rot your soul and that isn’t worth it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="2b5e" name="2b5e">If you are in a position to put in place a PfP system, just say no! I am not going to give you advice on how to. Just don’t. I know that it is counter cultural. But you have a chance to avoid the traps that PfP creates. If you default to the blunt instrument of PfP, you will get blunt results — and you won’t like them. Instead, work on building a culture in which your people care about the customer and care about each other.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

I have already written on the first three in the Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) series. So, I have decided to make my 38th PTW/PI on Playing to Win &amp; Agile. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="be73" name="be73"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is Agile?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="142f" name="142f">For the those who aren’t already aficionados, Agile is software development doctrine that dates from the release of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/" href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Agile Manifesto</a> in 2001. The Manifesto espouses four values:</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4bb8" name="4bb8"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">1)</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Individuals and interactions</em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong>&gt; processes and tools</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="affd" name="affd"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">2)</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Working software</em> &gt; comprehensive documentation</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fafe" name="fafe"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">3)</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Customer collaboration</em> &gt; contract negotiation</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1ff5" name="1ff5"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">4)</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Responding to change</em> &gt; following a plan</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d80b" name="d80b">These in turn are reflected in the 12 Principles of Agile pictured above.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="572a" name="572a">Agile was a reaction to the standard ‘<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://learn.marsdd.com/article/product-development-the-waterfall-methodology-model-in-software-development/" href="https://learn.marsdd.com/article/product-development-the-waterfall-methodology-model-in-software-development/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">waterfall</a>’ approach to software development at the time. The Agile founders saw waterfall as an unhelpfully linear, inflexible, and internally centered way to develop software, and in response developed an iterative, flexible and user centered alternative.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6e0f" name="6e0f">As is evident from the wording of the Principles, Agile was an approach targeted specifically at software development (i.e., #1, #3 and #7 all mention software specifically). However, in large part through the work of the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/" href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scrum Alliance</a>, the Agile approach has been applied more generally to project management of all sorts.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4d66" name="4d66"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Sometimes Frosty</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="23ce" name="23ce">Sometimes Agile enthusiasts can be quite frosty about strategy. To some Agile/Scrum folks, strategy is representative of the great enemy, waterfall, which Agile seeks to slay. I must say, their concerns are not entirely misplaced. They focus on software development’s analog, which is strategic plan development. Their criticism is consistent with my criticism of most strategic planning as too linear, too process focused, too internally oriented, and too impervious to adjustments as learning occurs along the way. So, I understand the frostiness: it is largely deserved by the standard approach to strategic plan development. I argue for a very different approach to strategy across this Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights series. But it is not the normal practice, so the Agile frostiness is understandable.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a80a" name="a80a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">My Frostiness</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="212d" name="212d">But I have my own frostiness when it comes to Agile and strategy. The Agile aficionados who see Scrum/Agile as a broadly applicable project management tool can wander into the territory of viewing Agile as a de facto strategy development process. That is, great strategy will emerge naturally if you simply listen to customers, expose them frequently to iterations of the offering, adjust repeatedly to take account of new learning from the client, and work in well-functioning, face-to-face teams.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="41db" name="41db">That is where I part company, as I also do with many of the Design Thinking folks. No amount of listening to customers, short cycle iteration, self-organization/emergence, face-to-face working teams, and reflectiveness is, on its own, going to produce a robust strategy. That is despite my belief that strategy does have to start with customers, and that I am a fan of iterative prototyping and flexible processes that change with new information. But even with those things, you ignore the principles of strategy at your peril.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3b5b" name="3b5b">All those features are positive contributors to a better rather than worse strategy. But strategy requires understanding of the economic viability of your choice and the sustainability of advantage relative to current and potential competitors. I have seen far too many of both user-centered Design Thinking processes and Agile processes that have no concept of economic viability or sustainability relative to competitors, despite producing products/services or software that users like. Good strategies are always a subset of the range of possibilities that would make users happy. The ones you want are those that make users deliriously happy in a way by which you can deliver distinctively.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d87d" name="d87d">The fundamental strategy limitation of Agile is that the opposites of its basic premises are stupid on their face. (And the same holds as well for Design Thinking.) The core rule of strategy is that if <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/@roger_78069/is-the-opposite-of-your-choice-stupid-on-its-face-5b247ffd7f94" href="https://medium.com/@roger_78069/is-the-opposite-of-your-choice-stupid-on-its-face-5b247ffd7f94" target="_blank">the opposite of your choice is stupid on its face</a>, it isn’t a strategic choice. Not listening to customers is stupid on its face. Not changing when change is required is stupid in its face.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d1c5" name="d1c5">If the opposite is stupid on its face, in due course everyone will do the smart thing. Reputedly, 90% of the Fortune 500 uses an SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. It has come to the point whereby not having an ERP system is stupid on its face. Having one is not a competitive advantage — since 90% of your competitors are likely to have one. It is just dumb not to do it. That is the trouble with winning. When a choice becomes obvious and it is doable for everyone, everyone does it. In contrast, strategy is the act of making choices whereby the opposite is not stupid on its face. That is what can lead to distinctive advantage.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="52c7" name="52c7">I assume that in some industries, no competitor is doing Agile and by being Agile, you will have obvious advantage because everyone else is inflexibly ignoring the customer. So, do it while it lasts. But that is not the long-term answer.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2109" name="2109"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Long-Term Answer</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1126" name="1126">The long-term answer is to combine the principles of Agile and Playing to Win. It is to do strategy in an Agile way. Start with the customer. But don’t just aim to serve the customer. Aim to do so in a way that enables you to be distinctive. Iterate with different ideas and approaches as you learn new things from the customer’s experiences with your prototypes. Keep working and working to build a unique solution that creates economics that work for your model and is difficult for competitors (existing or potential) to follow. If it is an idea that customers love — ordering pet food online — great, but you have to be able to make a case for why twenty other sites won’t pop up to sell pet food online (and they did!) in order for your customer insights to generate a useful economic model. Don’t assume that being Agile (or using Design Thinking) alone will provide you a competitive advantage that is worth having because it most likely won’t!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bee8" name="bee8"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3409" name="3409">If you are an Agile (and/or Scrum) aficionado, I encourage you to use the Agile Principles to enhance the customer-centric, iterative, and flexible nature of your strategy development. By doing so, you can make strategy development much more effective. However, be very careful to avoid getting seduced by the idea that meeting a newly discovered customer need will provide you with competitive advantage. It only will if you can build Must-Have Capabilities and Enabling Management Systems that competitors either can’t or won’t replicate. A strategy that doesn’t pass <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/distinguishing-how-to-win-from-capabilities-in-your-strategy-choice-fd190484ccea" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/distinguishing-how-to-win-from-capabilities-in-your-strategy-choice-fd190484ccea" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the can’t/won’t test</a> isn’t really a strategy at all.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="48b7" name="48b7">If you are a Playing to Win aficionado, pay attention to how to integrate the most valuable aspects of Agile into your strategy development process. Agile features including customer focus, responsiveness to changing findings and needs, iteration, business and technology people working together in a collaborative and sustainable manner, all contribute to better strategy development. Any strategy aficionado would be remiss in not taking advantage of applying these insights from the world of Agile to strategy development.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="e09e" name="e09e">In the end it is a classic situation in which the right choice is to get the best of both rather than accepting a false choice of either being Agile or doing strategy. The answer is to integrate both for a superior outcome.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

To survive and prosper, every organization must succeed in Balancing Exploration and Exploitation. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7151" name="7151"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Original Insight</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2566" name="2566">The original insight is courtesy of the late James March, a fascinating professor jointly appointed at the Stanford Graduate Schools of both Business and Education. I got to know him through one of his PhD students and collaborator of mine, Hilary Austen. While not widely known outside his field, March was an influential scholar. In an <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2003/12/who-are-the-gurus-gurus" href="https://hbr.org/2003/12/who-are-the-gurus-gurus" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interesting article</a> in Harvard Business Review back in 2003, the authors asked the 200 names on a prominent list of business gurus who their gurus were — i.e. the gurus’ gurus. Unsurprisingly, #1 was the greatest management thinker of all time, Peter Drucker, with 8 votes. But alone in second place was the much less famous March with 7 votes, only one vote behind Peter the Great! It is further notable that despite his eminence as a management thinker, his true passion was French poetry, of which he authored 11 books.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="edb5" name="edb5">In 1991, he wrote an influential article in Organization Science, entitled <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Exploration and Exploitation in Organizational Learning.</em> As with pretty much all great thinking contributions, it is obvious after it is pointed out. The article points out that all organizations operate in two contrasting modes. One is exploration, which is about doing new things at which we are not yet good — in March’s words “Exploration includes things captured by terms such as search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, innovation.” The other is exploitation, which is about doing things at which we are already proficient more intensively and incrementally better than previously — in March’s words: “Exploitation includes such things as refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, execution.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0afe" name="0afe">Others had talked about similar distinctions before. But his contribution that was new to me and helpful was to the organizational challenges that the existence of these two modes present.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b175" name="b175"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Organizational Implications</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0ff7" name="0ff7">The organizational challenge is that exploitation is more straightforward, faster acting and the rewards come sooner. In March’s words: “Compared to returns from exploitation, returns from exploration are systematically less certain, more remote in time, and organizationally more distant from the locus of action and adaption.” The exploration path is fraught with twists and turns, is harder to predict and there is often a time gap between efforts and results. When a unit of resources, whether a dollar or a person-hour, devoted to exploitation is held up beside a similar unit of exploration, by most standard measures, the latter beats the former. At the time of investment, it just looks better. Again, to use the words of the master: “The essence of exploitation is the refinement and extension of existing competences, technologies, and paradigms. Its returns are positive, proximate, and predictable. The essence of exploration is experimentation with new alternatives. Its returns are uncertain, distant, and often negative.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="346a" name="346a">Pursuing exploitation makes sense: why not do more of and hone and refine what has a clearer and (apparently) higher likelihood of success? But the danger, of course, is if you keep dedicating incremental resources to exploitation, exploration will fade into the background — and potentially away entirely. It will always feel like the time for exploration is sometime in the future, a time that never seems to come!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f67c" name="f67c">But exploitation only works as long as the competitive environment is stable. The hidden downside of exploitation it that it works only until it stops working. That happens especially if a competitor or new entrant in exploration mode drives a meaningful change that obsoletes the exploitation. March is clear that “maintaining an appropriate balance between exploration and exploitation is a primary factor in system survival and prosperity.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9e87" name="9e87">Less intuitive and critically important to the issue of strategy is March’s conclusion that exploration is more important if your goal is to win, and exploitation is more important if your goal is to avoid losing. That is, if you want to finish first against the relevant competitive set, that will only happen if you dedicate a healthy level of resources to exploration. But if you want to avoid finishing last in the competitive race, then focusing on exploitation is what will accomplish that job.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2981" name="2981"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Role of the Modern Equity Markets</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a4e2" name="a4e2">The pervasive trap of overinvesting in exploitation and underinvesting in exploration is exacerbated by the modern public equity markets. While we might think romantically about the individual investors making decisions to invest their hard-earned capital in one stock versus another with the hope of earning a high return on the back of that company succeeding disproportionately, that isn’t the modern world of investing. It is dominated by fiduciaries: pension funds, like CalPERS, New York State Common Retirement Fund, Texas Teachers, IBM, Boeing, AT&amp;T, and investment managers, like Black Rock, Fidelity, State Street and Vanguard. Because they are fiduciary institutions, the portfolio managers within them are much more worried about avoiding downside than achieving upside. While earning the highest returns for their clients would be nice, it pales in comparison to the ignominy of being in the lowest quartile. In fact, indexers like Vanguard institutionalize their avoidance of the downside by not picking at all. If the market is down; they will be down along with nearly everybody else.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c020" name="c020">As a consequence, the most powerful players in modern public equity markets all ask the same thing of public companies: achieve above average growth and profitability with below average risk. It is, of course, delusional, as with much of the goings on in the modern public capital markets. It isn’t Lake Woebegone for those companies. They all can’t be above average, especially while making sure to not engage in any risky activity. But the consequence is a greater push on exploitation than March would have noted as of 1991. And if you don’t focus enough on exploitation, the activist hedge funds will enter the picture and force adherence to it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cb05" name="cb05">Meanwhile, there is another pool of equity capital centered in the Bay Area. It both understands and seeks exploration. It fully appreciates that many of the entities in which it invests will expire worthless. But the successful explorers will provide 10X, 100X and even 1000X returns. And that pool of capital just keeps getting bigger and bigger.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4616" name="4616">In the modern capital markets, widely held public companies are pushed aggressively to exploitation and venture-backed companies only get funded if they are dedicated to exploration. This is and will continue to be bad news for the exploiters. They are being held to a different standard — growth without risk. At the same time, another class of competitor is being funded explicitly to disrupt them by exploring writ large. The irony, of course, is that some of those pension funds are investing capital into private equity pools whose goal is to invest in startups in fintech, med-tech, ed-tech, auto-tech, etc. that are aimed at destroying the companies in the public equity portfolios of those same pension funds. It is turning those exploiters into sitting ducks for those funded to explore. Even though 90% of the explorers will fail ignominiously, it only takes the 1-in-10 success to devastate the exploiter.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="26a1" name="26a1">The most common exploiter response has been to outsource exploration. The big legacy public companies let someone else explore and then pay gigantic acquisition prices for the few that succeed. And their equity investors don’t mind them paying huge prices for companies that they see as being already finished with their risky exploration. It is pathetic, but it is the modern way.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cd96" name="cd96"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="670c" name="670c">Regardless of how high or low you sit in an organization; you need to recognize these two modes and know when you are engaging in each. What you should do and how you should think about the two are different.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6a4d" name="6a4d">If you are engaging in exploitation, analyzing the past to cost-reduce and more deeply penetrate the current Where-to-Play using the current How-to-Win, talk about your work openly. Be enthusiastic about it. You will be embraced and supported.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1fac" name="1fac">If you are engaging in exploration, be careful talking about it. It is better to do it as secretly as possible with the least disclosure of the costs. Most importantly, don’t overpromise results or timeframes thereof. That is what got Steve Jobs fired. He promised huge volumes for the frame breaking MacIntosh and they didn’t arrive on the promised schedule. And if Steve Jobs can be fired for exploration, I can promise you that you can be too!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dab6" name="dab6">If you are in a public company, try to find allies on the board that will let you experiment and will defend what you are doing when you will need the support — and you will. If you are in a private company, you are in better shape. But you still need allies.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ebd8" name="ebd8">One of the most fascinating assertions in the March article — which I buy at a visceral and experiential level — concerns the individual level. He first observes that the pace of learning in the exploration mode is slower than in the exploitation mode. So, for successful exploration, you need people who are willing to accept a slow learning journey. The second thing he observes is that the benefits of the slow learning are asymmetric. The slow learners engaging in exploration get almost no benefits from the fast-learning exploiters in their organization, while the fast-learning exploiters get huge benefits from exploiting the successful explorations of the slow learners.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f58d" name="f58d">My Monitor Company experience mirrored this to perfection. During my entire time there, I was the #1 explorer, and it wasn’t even close. I received zero benefit of my exploration from Monitor but the toolbox I created out of the exploration is still being exploited profitably by the firm even though I left it 23 years ago. I am not complaining by the way. I have gotten plenty of rewards outside of Monitor for my efforts in exploration. But it does reinforce March’s point. At the individual level, exploration will have to be much more intrinsically than extrinsically motivated.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="e2dd" name="e2dd">But the secret at the individual level is to maintain a balance. I got away with my exploration efforts by being one of the most successful Directors in the firm measured by exploitation metrics. It meant lots of extra work to explore, but I achieved a sustainable balance. And that balance, I believe, is what made the second coming of Steve Jobs a hero. When he came back, I believe that the track record shows that he dedicated energy to both exploration and exploitation and created a trillion dollars of value. It is a path that everyone should aspire to follow.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

I have already chronicled one of the biggest wastages of effort in business: <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/its-time-to-accept-that-pay-for-performance-doesn-t-work-716017c62177" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/its-time-to-accept-that-pay-for-performance-doesn-t-work-716017c62177" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pay for performance (PfP) systems</a>. The other giant waste of time and energy is revenue forecasting, which makes it harder to have an effective strategy. Because I can’t stand wasted human effort, I am dedicating my 40th Playing to Win/Practitioners Insights (PTW/PI) to The Delusion of Revenue Forecasting. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d232" name="d232"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Two Sections of the Income Statement</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c5a5" name="c5a5">Every company has costs and revenues. Since they occupy the two sections of the same income statement, revenues and costs are typically viewed and treated similarly. It appears logical that companies should plan and forecast for each. The product is a budget, and every company has one.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a9ce" name="a9ce">As everyone knows, immense amount of work goes into budgeting. There is an annual budget cycle with meeting after meeting, review after review. If it is a public company, eventually the budget goes to the board for approval. There is always very detailed work on costs — what number of people to employ, at what salaries; what amount of raw materials to procure; how much to advertise; how much R&amp;D to perform; what volume of space to lease or rent, etc. No stone is left unturned in forecasting and budgeting for costs. The same holds for revenues — how much of each product/service will we sell at what prices, to which customers, in which regions, through which distribution channels.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2aab" name="2aab">The forecasting goes back and forth with extensive negotiations because the revenue budget is typically tied to PfP goals. The task is to get to an agreed upon and approved budget to which you can commit, and your commitment is secured by making your compensation depend on achieving the forecast.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="23a5" name="23a5"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Big Difference Between Sections</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0b74" name="0b74">Despite being similar and in many ways equal parts of the same income statement, revenues and costs have one giant difference that has a profound impact on forecasting. That difference is with respect to the identity of the customer.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="253a" name="253a">Who is the customer of your costs? You are. You decide everything. Sure, there are surcharges. If you procure a square foot of office space, the municipality imposes a property tax cost on you. But it is entirely a function of your choice to procure the square foot and that tax surcharge is known with precision in advance of your decision. Since costs are entirely within your control, forecasting and budgeting costs makes a lot of sense. In addition, there is no reason not to be able to manage costs precisely during the year and to hit your cost forecast/budget because you make all the choices.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f7a4" name="f7a4">Who, on the other hand, is the customer of your revenues? Of course, customers are. They decide everything. There is no reason to think that you should be able to forecast, budget or manage revenues because customers make all the choices. Precision in revenue forecasting is a pipe dream. Whereas you can be precise in cost forecasting, you can’t with revenue forecasting. It is delusional for you to think that you can know in advance what customers are going to do in the coming year. They are free agents who make their own decisions. They couldn’t care what your revenue forecast or budget is. They will buy what they want to buy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="66a6" name="66a6"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Making Revenues Show Up</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e7e4" name="e7e4">What makes revenues show up? It is your strategy. A strategy that creates a compelling value proposition for the customer is what makes revenues show up on your income statement. If you have a How-to-Win (HTW), backed up by the Must-Have Capabilities (MHC) and Enabling Management Systems (EMS), in a given Where-to-Play (WTP), revenue will show up. If you don’t, it won’t. This is why cost planning is so important. Your costs describe your investment in the EMS and MHC that produce your HTW in your WTP. That is the only thing that will make revenues show up.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ffb3" name="ffb3">Having a revenue budget has no positive impact on your strategy. In fact, the impact is negative. If your strategy happens to compel more revenue than planned to show up, having a budget will encourage slacking off and not delivering the strategy to its fullest potential. If the strategy compels less revenues than forecast to show up, having a budget target will cause destructive behavior. It will cause you to try to make customers do something that your strategy doesn’t compel them to do, like cutting prices to a level that makes the strategy unprofitable or pulling forward to this budget year revenues that would have naturally occurred next budget year. Smart customers will recognize when you are desperate for revenues at budget year end and ruthlessly exploit you to take advantage of the pressure you feel to make your revenue budget. In fact, the very cleverest wait until they know you are desperate before they buy anything at all.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ac1d" name="ac1d">If revenue forecasting and budgeting took zero time, the lack of any benefit and presence of many detriments would be less egregious. But revenue forecasting and budgeting absorbs millions (if not tens or hundreds of millions) of person-hours every year across the business world. Those millions of yearly person-hours could much more productively be applied to serving customers, building capabilities, refining strategy, etc. — all things that would actually compel customers to send you more revenues.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4a21" name="4a21"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Better Way</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="aa89" name="aa89">This one is simple: don’t forecast revenue. Don’t try to predict something that you can’t predict. And don’t tie your delusional predictions to a PfP system. Avoid forcing managers to commit to things to which no human should commit. It just creates fundamentally destructive behavior starting with endless budget gaming and then moving on to destructive revenue gaming.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9e4e" name="9e4e">Instead model your revenues. Change the question from what we imagine to be true (i.e., a forecast) to what would have to be true (WWHTBT). That is, given the costs that we are applying against our strategy, what volume of products/services would we need to sell at what price levels to earn a satisfactory return on the investments in our strategy. It is not a forecast. It is a measuring stick that will help you to judge whether your strategy is working or not by measuring progress against it. It will help you to adjust costs as you go and avoid taking desperate actions that will damage your business longer term.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3dd8" name="3dd8"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="afc7" name="afc7">It is hard to eliminate sacred cows, and revenue forecasting/revenue budgeting is one of the most sacred of all management cows. I liken it to a pacifier. Like a pacifier, having a revenue forecast that has been converted into a revenue budget provides a calming, soothing effect. Having one makes managers think they have increased the chances of achieving it even if there just isn’t evidence to support that notion — just like a pacifier really doesn’t do anything except provide the baby with a comforting distraction.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e2ef" name="e2ef">If you oversee a budget unit, try an experiment for a single budget cycle. Don’t make any pretense of forecasting revenues. Just model the revenues that you would require to have attractive profitability and set that as your target. Keep track of your progress toward the target and make sure to share it with everybody in the organization. Encourage everyone in the organization to do what they can in their area of responsibility to help the organization achieve the revenue target — but without deviating from the strategy. Make it their base job — not the subject of PfP. Try it. Run an experiment. People will tell you that without a rigorous revenue budget, life as we know it on the planet will end and we will be cast into a thousand years of darkness. When they do, hand them each a pacifier!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="d5a9" name="d5a9">If you are lower down in the hierarchy, you are just going to have to suck it up. Revenue forecasting is just another crazy business practice which you must endure. But try not to get caught up in the game and waste too much of your time on revenue forecasting rituals. From a customer perspective, none of the time you spend in revenue forecasting provides value to them. So put into it the minimum effort with which you can get away and continue to put the maximal effort into serving the customer. Attempt to avoid revenue manipulation games. That will cost you in the short term because those who play budget and revenue games most skillfully will benefit most in the short term. But if you pay attention to your strategy and your customer, your career will benefit in the long term. And when you are in charge, you can eliminate delusional revenue forecasting.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Martin, 2021</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="d3db" name="d3db">I get asked many questions about brands and their role in Playing to Win strategy. Branding is typically viewed as something that only B2C companies do to differentiate themselves. That doesn’t tell nearly enough of the story. That is why I have dedicated my 41st Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece to It’s All About Confidence: Mastering the Role of Branding in Strategy. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cc8b" name="cc8b"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Value of Brands</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c380" name="c380">Every year, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.forbes.com/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands/#20ee94e4119c" href="https://www.forbes.com/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands/#20ee94e4119c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Forbes publishes a list</a> of the most valuable brands in the world. They range across industries from #1 Apple at $241 billion to #11 Toyota ($42B) to #12 Intel ($40B) to #32 Hermès ($22B) to #41 Zara ($15B) to#99 FedEx ($8B). The calculation assigns the value based on the difference between the actual profitability of the company and the level that would be expected from an average performer.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="acf6" name="acf6">As such, the Forbes calculation mixes in another big factor over and above brand: a winning strategy by which each company is better than anyone in its competitive space. For Apple it is a system that consistently produces the most elegant, user-friendly hardware/software solutions. For Toyota it is the production system that the rest of the industry attempts to copy but never quite catches up. For Intel it is leadership scale in logic chips. For Hermès it is a proprietary designer-driven fashion delivery system. For Zara it is Inditex’s competitively superior manufacturing/logistics system and its leading scale from creating the category of fast fashion. And for FedEx it is a leading scale, end-to-end system for reliable package delivery. In fact, there are arguably very few companies on the list that aren’t obvious outperformers in their industry.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0a77" name="0a77">Even if these companies made little or no effort to maintain or build a ‘brand,’ they would show up as having a valuable brand on the Forbes list because each has an advantaged business system that generates supernormal returns.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e54e" name="e54e"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is Branding?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="17fb" name="17fb">If we want to have a useful understanding of the concept, we need a better definition of branding than the ability to generate high returns. That definition would make Saudi Aramco the most valuable brand in the world even though most people don’t know it exists. I define branding as a particular activity — the generation of confidence — that accentuates, and at its best maximizes, the value of a business system.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b71c" name="b71c">Effective branding activity results in customers having full confidence that they will receive the benefits that that your system is designed to deliver and that you promise to customers. That is, they will come to assume without conscious thought that your offering will deliver satisfaction. If they aren’t confident, you don’t have a brand worth having. That is why branding is centrally about customer confidence.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3cab" name="3cab">Apple has an awesome brand because customers are confident that the next Apple product that they buy will be easy-to-use out of the box, elegantly designed, and work well with all their other Apple products. Confidence is comfort and we all love comfort. Toyota customers are confident that their new vehicle will have the quality, reliability, and durability (QRD) for which Toyota is legendary. So, those customers are confident in making the big expenditure required to buy a new car if it is a Toyota. Intel customers are confident that their PC will work as expected if it has Intel Inside. Hermès customers are confident they will be (and seen to be) stylish if they are wearing Hermès. A husband is confident his wife will be pleased if he buys her a Hermès scarf. Meanwhile, a wife is confident her husband will be pleased if she buys him a Hermès tie. Zara customers are confident that if they walk into a Zara shop, they will find fashionable clothes at fantastic prices. And FedEx customers are confident that their package will absolutely, positively be there.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="97f9" name="97f9">All are on the Forbes list because they have competitive advantage AND have generated full confidence on the part of their customers.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4ea5" name="4ea5"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How Do You Master Branding?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2c3a" name="2c3a">Branding requires a simple cycle. You promise the customer that you are going to deliver and then you deliver. And then you repeat and repeat and repeat. The power is in the combination. If you do one and not the other, you will not grow a powerful brand.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e2b6" name="e2b6">If you are Tide, you promise that you will get clothes cleaner. And for 75 years, it has kept that promise. Plus, while doing so, it has repeatedly upped the definition of what getting clothes cleaner means. It compacted its powdered detergent to help you get clothes cleaner without wasting laundry space. It converted to liquid to make usage and dosing easier. It added bleach to Tide to get clothes cleaner plus whiter. It added fabric softener so that your cleaner clothes would also be softer. It enabled you to wash in cold water and still get clothes as clean as in hot water while saving on your electric bill. And it put all the ingredients in a single pod to make sure it cleaned in the easiest and most effective possible way. All along, it repeated a consistent promise and delivered on it faithfully in ever better ways, making it the dominant laundry detergent in America.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3628" name="3628">When there was a problematic gap between usage and a realization that the promise had been delivered, the same company, Proctor &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G), figured out a unique way to build confidence. In 1960, P&amp;G promised that thanks to its revolutionary fluoride ingredient, its Crest toothpaste would prevent cavities. But because that effect was not immediately evident to the customer, it needed to find an innovative way to generate confidence. Future P&amp;G CEO, John Smale who then ran the Crest brand, convinced the American Dental Association (ADA) to give its Seal of Acceptance to a toothpaste brand for the first time ever. Crest promised the customer that it would fight cavities and told the customer that the ADA Seal verified it — which built customer confidence until such time as the promised effect was realized at check-up time at the dentist.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a740" name="a740">Repetition is critical because it builds customer confidence over time with every cycle of promise and fulfilment. It hurts your brand if customers forget that they should be confident. This is why short-term campaigns are ineffective. I cringe every time I see a first-time advertiser spend millions on a single Superbowl ad and then disappear from the airwaves, thinking that its branding job has been done because 100+ million people saw its ad. But these advertisers and their expensive ads get forgotten in days.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d3f1" name="d3f1">Repeated cycles of promise and fulfilment build confidence. This reinforces why Byron Sharp is so astute about the importance of mental availability (his <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Brands-Grow-What-Marketers-ebook/dp/B07Q1K1BH3" href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Brands-Grow-What-Marketers-ebook/dp/B07Q1K1BH3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How Brands Grow</a> is a must read). Customers can’t possibly be confident about your brand if they don’t know it exists, or if other competing brands are more prominent in their minds, or if they have forgotten about you because you aren’t in front of them, making and remaking your promise to them. This is <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/customer-loyalty-is-overrated" href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/customer-loyalty-is-overrated" rel="noopener" target="_blank">why habit is so important</a> and why the goal of branding is to have the cycle of promise and fulfilment become so automatic that customers engage in it without conscious thought.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3890" name="3890"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">It is Not Just B2C</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4e1d" name="4e1d">Branding and this cycle of promise and fulfilment is equally applicable to the B2B world. Intel Inside is a promise made to Intel’s corporate buyers that buyers of the PCs they build with Intel processors will be happy that there is an Intel logic chip running their computer. Goldman Sachs promises that if a client hires one of its investment banking teams, it will get the desired transaction done and done well. Consistently fulfilling that promise is what has made it the top brand in that sector.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="226d" name="226d">Perhaps my favorite B2B brand is FedEx’s. FedEx doesn’t just promise to deliver on time and then delivers on time building your confidence in FedEx. Its advertising copy explicitly tells you that you should be confident: absolutely and positively! So, when FedEx delivers on-time for you, your reaction is “of course, they did” because they told you that you should be confident. And if you are still a little bit squeamish, FedEx led in enabling you to track your package through the entire journey so that your confidence never lags during the entire shipping experience. That is all brilliant branding which has resulted in the highest praise a brand can get: ‘to FedEx’ is now a verb!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1849" name="1849"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="772e" name="772e">It is really hard to build competitive advantage — providing something valuable to your customers that your competitors can’t/won’t replicate. Because it is so hard, it is a real shame to leave it at that.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d691" name="d691">I’m sure P&amp;G could have just put fluoride in Crest and let customers figure out over time that they got fewer cavities when they used Crest. I bet Crest would have eventually become a successful brand. But I doubt it would have rocketed to #1 share without advertising copy that promised cavity reduction and backed the promise with the ADA Seal. And without that, it is not clear that the Crest brand would have earned the resources to double down on its advertising and R&amp;D to be able to both maintain high mental availability of its promises and deliver on ever-loftier promises over the decades with a flow of technical breakthroughs.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4ebe" name="4ebe">Likewise, instead of branded Tide, P&amp;G could have sold its fantastic detergent as a store/private label brand, and it would have attracted customers because it is a great detergent. But it wouldn’t have enabled Tide to make and fulfil promises in a way that built the biggest and most profitable laundry habit in America.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="170b" name="170b">So, when you think branding, think first about confidence. How can you make a distinctive promise to your customers and then fulfill that promise in a way that builds their confidence that you will always fulfill your promises? As their confidence builds, your brand strengthens, generating the incremental resources to make and fulfill more compelling promises. Don’t waste your time making identical promises to your competitors. That will only convince your customers that it doesn’t matter who they choose. And never make a promise that you can’t fulfill because it will shatter confidence and that will put your brand into a death spiral.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

A number of readers have asked me to go deeper on it, so I have decided to make my 42nd PTW/PI on Can Your Strategy Pass Its Most Important Test. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f216" name="f216"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why This Test is So Important</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c565" name="c565">As I have often emphasized, the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/on-the-inseparability-of-where-to-play-and-how-to-win-181c2ea5c463" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/on-the-inseparability-of-where-to-play-and-how-to-win-181c2ea5c463" rel="noopener" target="_blank">heart of strategy</a> is a well-matched Where-to-Play/How-to-Win (WTP/HTW) pair. That means for a given product/service, for a given customer set, the offering is superior to that of competitors because the company achieves either a differentiated or low-cost position, which enables it to earn an attractive return.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9cf6" name="9cf6">Generally speaking, a company won’t have a problem with competitors if it fails to achieve the above. Competitors generally don’t spend a lot of time and resources attempting to copy a mediocre or failing model. However, if the company succeeds, its WTP/HTW acts as a powerful black hole that sucks every competitor toward it. While I am certainly not arguing that it is smart, the most common competitive response to a successful strategy is to try to replicate it as closely as possible.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0be2" name="0be2">That is why the only strategies worth investing in are those that pass the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t</em>/<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">won’t</em> test. The <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t</em> part means that competitors may well try, but try as they may, they just can’t put in place a value equation that matches yours. The <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">won’t</em> part means that while competitors could succeed if they were to try, they choose not to try. If your strategy doesn’t pass the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t</em>/<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">won’t</em> test, you will be fighting a battle that is headed relatively briskly toward the commodization of your competitive space, which will solve the attraction problem but not in a way that will make you happy!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="625b" name="625b"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Key to Can’t: History/Passage of Time</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dd0f" name="dd0f">It turns out that the key to passing the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t</em> test is history. To use an old (1989) <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgD9FyE60hs" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgD9FyE60hs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pop hit</a>, you want your competitors to lament as Cher does in the song: “If I could turn back time, if I could find a way.” Because they can’t find a way to turn back time, competitors can’t successfully neutralize your strategy and it passes the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t</em> part of the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t</em>/<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">won’t</em> test.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1dd1" name="1dd1">History has the potential to aid in the protection of your strategy from replication by any current or prospective competitors in one of ten ways that I have observed. There may well be more, but these are the ones I have seen.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="be72" name="be72">Because you started deploying your strategy before your current or prospective competitors…</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e89a" name="e89a">1) …you have had the chance to build greater current scale, which enables you to spend more than any competitor on the scale-sensitive cost items like advertising and R&amp;D. Tide got started before competitors at the inception of the washing machine era and has built a scale advantage over all competitors that enables it to advertise more and spend more on R&amp;D. IKEA started before competitors in user-assembled furniture and has monumental scale advantages.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="aa0c" name="aa0c">2) …you are farther down the learning curve in important areas such as customer knowledge or manufacturing expertise. Toyota adopted what are now called lean manufacturing practices before every competitor and is still ahead of its competitors decades later. Zara created the fast fashion category and has more customer and operating knowledge than any competitor.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5a4c" name="5a4c">3) …you have accumulated more essential content. Legal information provider WestLaw started over a century ago to create ‘headnotes’ for cases coming out of the legal system and developed the West Key Number System, which has become the de facto standard for categorizing cases. To compete with WestLaw, a competitor would have to go back a century to recreate the enormous volume of content, essentially an impossible task. Meanwhile WestLaw only needs to update as new cases come out of the courts, a big but doable task. Similarly, Disney has built up a century of content such as beloved characters and storylines that can be repeatedly repurposed that no competitor can match</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d005" name="d005">4) …you have accumulated more data. Uber has more data on drivers, volumes, pricing than any competitor enabling it to optimize its system to a greater extent. Tesla has more fully electric miles driven by its connected vehicles than any competitor enabling it to know more about usage patterns and charging requirements than any competitor.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b50c" name="b50c">5) …you have become the default habit of the customers. Because Lego popularized the construction toy segment, millions of grandparents and parents pass on to their children the habit of playing with Lego, making it extremely difficult for competitors to cause children to break their Lego habit once they have started it. Ford F-150 has become the default habit of more full-size pickup truck buyers than for any other competitor.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f849" name="f849">6) …you have network effects going for you that they can’t access. AT&amp;T was the first to notice and talk about the network effect in telephone services at the beginning of the 20th century and those network effects ensured AT&amp;T’s dominance for the better part of that century. Facebook has such network effects going for it that competitors simply can’t match it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="68bc" name="68bc">7) …you have locked up the key assets necessary for competitive advantage. These could be a distribution channel, like office furniture dealers for Steelcase, or physical inputs, like bauxite for Alcan or Alcoa, or locations/real estate, like vending machine locations for Coca Cola or billboard locations for Clear Channel, or regulatory rights, like spectrum for Verizon.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a49d" name="a49d">8) …you were able to patent something that legally blocks competitors from copying. This is the primary advantage held by most pharmaceutical companies plus some technology companies, such as patent licensing maven, Qualcomm</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3f0d" name="3f0d">9) …you have grown to stand for something unique in the minds of customers. The physical offering of venerable luxury brands such as Hermès, Four Seasons and Dom Pérignon can be copied but customers won’t treat the copier as the real thing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5678" name="5678">10) …your assets have been depreciated on your financial statements making it financially easier for you to provide your offering to customers. The Ambassador Bridge connecting Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Ontario across the busiest border crossing in North America was finished in 1929 at a cost of about $350 million (in 2021 $) and acquired by the Maroun family in 1979 for about $100 million ($2021). The competitive Gordie Howe Bridge will cost at least $6 billion to finish and will have to charge accordingly.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="08d5" name="08d5"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Key to Won’t: Giving Up Something of Value</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9080" name="9080">The key to passing the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">won’t</em> test is giving up. If competitors would have to give up something of value in order to replicate your strategy, and they choose not to, even though they have the capabilities to do so, your strategy passes the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">won’t</em> part of the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t</em>/<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">won’t</em> test.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0977" name="0977">The necessity of giving up something of value has the potential to aid in the protection of your strategy from replication by any current or prospective competitor in one of seven ways. Again, there may be more, but these are the ones that I have seen.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3066" name="3066">Your current or prospective competitors would refuse to accept, as a component of replicating your strategy, the necessity of giving up…</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="68a8" name="68a8">1) …their existing distribution channel. Estée Lauder could have used its lowest-end prestige brand, Clinique, to fight P&amp;G’s relaunched Olay in the mass channels. But the prestige channel would likely have kicked out Clinique and that was too big a price for Lauder to pay. Unfortunately, what worked for P&amp;G on Olay worked against it on Gillette. Had P&amp;G immediately replicated nascent Dollar Shave Club with its own club, its retailers would have revolted. It had to wait until Dollar Shave Club made a huge dent in the business to respond.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b086" name="b086">2) … their existing asset base. Continental with its Continental Lite offering could possibly have replicated Southwest Airlines, but it would have had to have divested most of its aircraft and many of its gates. Traditional furniture retailers could have at least tried to replicate IKEA’s strategy but that would have meant writing off their showrooms and creating new logistics systems.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3484" name="3484">3) …their existing employees. Luxury hotel competitors could have attempted to replicate Four Seasons service model, but it would have meant wholesale swapping out of their current hotel staff.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1b91" name="1b91">4) …their existing margins. Merrill Lynch probably had every necessary capability to blunt the advance of discount broker Charles Schwab or even defeat it in its early stages. But that would have meant giving up the much higher margins for full-service brokerage. Similarly, newspapers could have fought eBay but that would have meant damaging their most profitable line of business, which was classified ads.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b917" name="b917">5) …their existing beliefs. Harley Davidson could have defended against Honda’s entry into the US motorcycle market in the early 1960s. But it would have had to give up on its belief that American customers didn’t want 50cc motorcycles — which it was unwilling to do.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="597f" name="597f">6) …their independence. Limo and taxi drivers could have at least curbed Uber’s untrammeled progress by quickly forming their own large-scale Transportation Network Company. But they would have had to give up their independence as either sole proprietors or small companies. That wasn’t in the cards.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e8fc" name="e8fc">7) …their existing habits/practices. The major strategy consulting shops could limit or entirely halt the incursion of the major design firms into their traditional territory of strategy advice. But that would require dropping the habit/practice of only hiring quantitatively focused recruits from quantitatively oriented programs. But they won’t change their existing habits/practices, so design firms have an unimpeded path.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fd2f" name="fd2f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1b61" name="1b61">It is too much work to create a unique new strategy for it to be replicated as soon as it shows itself to be successful. In fact, such an activity is unlikely to justify the investment in achieving the temporary uniqueness. That is why before you settle on a strategy and make the necessary investments to build or strengthen the Must-Have Capabilities (MHC) and Enabling Management Systems (EMS), you stress-test your strategy with the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t</em>/<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">won’t </em>test. You shouldn’t settle for less.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6763" name="6763">Check the 17 possibilities above to see whether one (or more) applies to you vis-à-vis each of the existing competitors and plausible entrants. And if you can think of another <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t</em>/<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">won’t </em>that applies in your situation: great!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="67b1" name="67b1">If your strategy doesn’t pass the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t</em>/<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">won’t </em>test, don’t toss it out. Treat that as a challenge. How can you tweak your WTP/HTW to strengthen your performance on the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t</em>/<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">won’t </em>test? Would a shift in your WTP move you more into the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">won’t </em>territory? Could you enhance your HTW to bring into play a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t </em>element? Or would a greater investment in a particular MHC enhance your <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t </em>performance?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="b921" name="b921">This is what makes the difference between OK strategy and great strategy. It is the moral equivalent of the role of great editing. The writer’s initial story may be pretty good. But a couple rounds of editing by a great editor will make it truly memorable. Don’t settle for a strategy that kind of/sort of passes the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can’t</em>/<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">won’t </em>test. Work it until it passes the test with flying colors. It will be worth it!</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Because I think it is important to understand the critical link between strategy and sales, I have dedicated my 43rd Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece to Playing to Win &amp; Sales: Clarifying the Place of the Missing Function. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e185" name="e185"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Missing Function</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5469" name="5469">When I took my MBA, there was no course in sales in the whole school. But I didn’t give it any thought at the time. I took the required courses and chose my electives from the wide array of available alternatives. But when I started my term as Dean of the Rotman School a couple of decades later, I paid a lot more attention to what we were and were not teaching. There were multiple courses in virtually all the functions that I was used to seeing in every company: finance, marketing, accounting, operations, OB/HR, strategy, and IT. We even had courses for which students could cross-register at the law school related to the legal function and at the engineering school related to the R&amp;D function. But one major corporate function was missing: sales. There wasn’t (and I believe 23 years later still isn’t) a single course on sales.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ca5b" name="ca5b">Given that it is obvious that the sales function is critical to the success of every company — because without revenues a company won’t survive — I thought it odd that we had no course in sales and did some exploration, which confirmed that for sure it was odd logically but not unusual in practice. I couldn’t find a single sales course at any peer business school. Occasionally there are sales courses but mainly in lower-ranking business schools. But it is safe to say that only a tiny fraction of MBA students — probably under 1% — have access to a course on the topic of sales in their program.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2d05" name="2d05">It is not as though there isn’t demand for sales education. Sales training is a multi-billion-dollar industry, which by my rough estimate has annual revenues equivalent to around one-third of the revenues of the entire MBA business. Given the major challenge these days for MBA programs to maintain their revenues, it is striking that they have handed over this huge revenue stream to commercial providers.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="41f8" name="41f8">Why don’t business schools have courses in sales? The explanation I get when I ask business academics is that it isn’t a research field. That is, there are few academic journals and no prestigious ones for scholarship in sales. Therefore, professors can’t make it a field of study in which they would be able to earn tenure. Therefore, there aren’t sales professors. Therefore, there aren’t sales courses.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ffe8" name="ffe8">I think that chicken and egg dynamic is real. But an equally important reason is that business academics think the field is below them. Marketing is lofty and intellectually rich. Sales is déclassé and boring. But it isn’t! While some products/services sell themselves, most don’t. As a consequence, sales is a critically important function that should not be AWOL at business schools — for both their sakes and those of their students.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3317" name="3317"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Sales vs. Marketing</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4980" name="4980">To be able to specify the link between strategy and sales, we need a useful definition of sales, which is often comingled unhelpfully with marketing. And remember, I believe <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/its-time-to-accept-that-marketing-and-strategy-are-one-discipline-17f0140521c9" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/its-time-to-accept-that-marketing-and-strategy-are-one-discipline-17f0140521c9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">there is no longer a useful distinction between marketing and strategy</a>, but rather than call it strategy/marketing, I will refer it as to marketing for short in this piece.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8163" name="8163">At the broadest level, I think about marketing as ‘wholesale’ and sales as ‘retail.’ That is, marketing is aimed at customers as a collective. It engages in determining the offering for a given set of customers, the Where-to-Play (WTP), and the method for winning with that set of customers, the How-to-Win (HTW). Meanwhile, sales is aimed at the customer in front of the salesperson, typically one salesperson on one customer, even if the buying unit is made up of multiple people, such as a couple buying a car or a procurement group buying a jet engine. (In a tiny minority of cases, the sales activity can involve selling to a group of distinct customers as with a wealth management salesperson selling to a group of potential investors in a hotel conference room.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2f38" name="2f38">Until relatively recently, sales activities were entirely face-to-face. Then in the late 1960s telemarketing became the new thing in selling. The name is unfortunate because it isn’t telemarketing; it is actually tele-sales — interacting with a single customer. And of course, now much of sales is not even human-to-human with cookie tracking of individuals and chat-bots doing the interaction. For me, the ads served up to you personally by Google or Facebook are sales, not marketing because they are targeted at you alone. It may be an ad designed by marketing to appeal to people like you. But the act of positioning it in front of you as an individual makes it a sales activity by my definition.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6e54" name="6e54">So, marketing includes defining the product/service, determining its price, deciding where to sell it, and running ad campaigns for it — the classic 4Ps. Sales involves interacting with an individual customer in service of the marketing. An ever-increasingly critical component of sales in the modern world is to use the opportunities provided by Internet search to find you, the individual, and talk to you as an individual — annoying as that may have become.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="80f8" name="80f8"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Positive Role of Sales for Marketing/Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d151" name="d151">There are two important and positive roles that sales can play in support of the intent of marketing/strategy, enhancing mental availability and confidence.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9b9f" name="9b9f">On mental availability, customers won’t buy your offering if they don’t know it exists, or if they have forgotten about you, or even if other competing offerings are more prominent in their minds. There is only so much mental availability that can be achieved with marketing activities such as advertising. The sales function is the outreach that keeps mental availability high. Goldman Sachs will get some of its business from overall brand recognition. But if its partners don’t show up to visit CEOs and CFOs to remind them about what Goldman Sachs can do for them, those executives may choose someone for their transaction who did visit more recently. If that winery salesperson didn’t offer you a taste of a featured wine in the grocery store, chances are you would have walked right by it on the store shelf. Those may be very different contexts, but they are both efforts in enhancing mental availability.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5b92" name="5b92">On confidence, the positive role of sales is to provide the confidence that if a customer buys, it will be happy. Of course, there are many ways that sales can accomplish that. A salesperson can customize the offering for the customer as with home insurance, clothing, or conference facilities. A salesperson can provide detailed information that helps the customer feel confident in what it is buying, such as explaining the functionality and features of a smart home system. A salesperson can ally concerns that the customer may have, such as explaining the warranty coverage or return policy. A salesperson can instill confidence by showing that the salesperson cares enough to spend time with the customer.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="237f" name="237f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Positive Role of Marketing/Strategy for Sales</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="37d7" name="37d7">The road between marketing/strategy and sales runs both ways. Marketing/strategy can equally play a positive role in helping the sales function succeed. The key feature is precision in WTP and HTW. The bane of all sales is an overbroad WTP. In that case, sales has to call on too many customers, for many of which there is no HTW. That wastes salesforce time on customers that are highly unlikely to buy. That is costly in terms of both time and morale. Hit rate is critical to both cost of sales and morale. A low hit rate results in high costs and elevated turnover. Hence, a tightly defined WTP is extremely helpful to sales.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="87b0" name="87b0">The other challenge is a ‘how to play’ rather than HTW. Salespeople can’t build their own confidence in winning when the way to win is not specified by marketing. Likewise, they can’t build customer confidence that the offering is best for the customer when it just plain isn’t. A ‘how to play’ results in a lower hit rate, longer sales cycles, and sales function turnover.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7433" name="7433">That is why sales benefits from a tightly defined WTP and a real HTW.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1cb3" name="1cb3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">An Unhelpful Role of Sales in Marketing/Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b4bb" name="b4bb">To me this is clear but will be controversial. The most unhelpful role for sales to play is in negotiating price, even though it is commonly done. The problem with allowing sales to engage in price negotiation with the customer is that the vast majority of the sales call will be taken up by the negotiation and it will crowd out the time the salesperson can spend on boosting both mental availability and customer confidence. In fact, it undermines a key attribute of confidence: Am I confident that I am getting the best deal or did some other customer negotiate harder and more successfully?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="55b0" name="55b0">Whenever I make this argument, people tell me that it is impractical and can’t be done, that customers like to negotiate price with their salesperson. I have yet to see hard evidence that is the case — though I don’t deny that some customer segment may exist in some markets that wants to negotiate with their salesperson. I am told, for example, that negotiating price is absolutely necessary for success in the automotive retailing business. Well tell that to rigidly no-haggle CarMax, now the biggest in the industry, and Carvana, #8 and fastest growing. Both are doing enviably well. Their salespeople know they have no authority to negotiate price and the customers don’t expect it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3fc7" name="3fc7">Is there any positive role for price negotiation? Sure, but by marketing not sales. If the offering isn’t working at the set price, that feedback is a helpful form of implicit negotiation from customers. But it is for marketing to fix the WTP/HTW, not for sales to start price negotiating. Sales is there to boost mental availability and customer confidence — and those two critical jobs are it!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5318" name="5318"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f441" name="f441">If you are an MBA student, badger your Dean to get real and provide at least one rigorous course on sales. If you are a business school Dean, recognize (if you don’t already) that the MBA business is in secular decline, but the sales training business continues to grow. It is mistake from a student learning perspective to withhold sales education from them, plus you are giving a huge revenue stream to commercial providers. Providing sales education at your school is a win-win.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="e4eb" name="e4eb">For companies, it is important to distinguish between marketing and sales and make sure both do their respective jobs. Marketing (aka strategy) is there to define a WTP/HTW. Sales is there to enhance both mental availability and confidence for the customer in front of it — whether that is in person, on the phone, or online. The more precise WTP and powerful HTW that marketing defines, the more successful sales will be in enhancing the effectiveness of that WTP/HTW combination. And make sure to ban price negotiation on the part of sales. Sales has a suite of offerings with prices in its portfolio and its job is to sell them.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

I thought the question was terrific — both timely and important. So, I decided to dedicate my 44th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) to Diversity &amp; Strategy. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="65b3" name="65b3">I will start with the second part of the question (diversity in strategy development) because the answer to it has implications for the first part of the question (diversity strategy).</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="770c" name="770c"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Diversity in Strategy Development</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b400" name="b400">The short answer to the first question is that diversity is very important for great strategy development. But let me provide a longer answer with my reasoning.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="280e" name="280e">One of the biggest obstacles to the development of a high-quality strategy is narrowness — a constrained view of available strategy choices and convergence relatively quickly on a chosen one. That is why one of the most frequent complaints about strategy is that it isn’t creative; it doesn’t get the company in question out of whatever box it was in at the outset.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="56da" name="56da">To combat that gravitational pull, I built my process for strategy development with the goal of gaining maximum advantage from diversity of thought and opinion. I insist on generating a breadth of possibilities and refuse to allow speedy convergence on a standard line of thinking. I refer to strategy ideas as <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">possibilities</em> not <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">options</em> because the latter feels more formal and may trigger self-censoring of interesting ideas. I also refuse to allow criticism of possibilities — at all. If the central question is ‘what do you think is true,’ then the conversation is often dominated by the loudest voice and typically a critically negative one, which hastens the group toward premature convergence and away from novel ideas. Instead of asking participants whether they favor a possibility or think it is valid, I ask them to specify what would have to be true (WWHTBT) for the possibility to be a great choice, which is an optimistic take. Further, I insist that possibilities eliminate themselves rather than be eliminated by a member of the group. Elimination should only happen when a WWHTBT that is agreed upon by the group is shown not to be likely enough to be true based on testing that is designed by the whole group.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="88ee" name="88ee">I believe it is critical to great strategy to source as diverse a set of possibilities as feasible and then keep them alive for long enough for their best features to show themselves. In the end, all you need is one awesome idea — and I can promise you based on decades of experience that you never know in advance from where it is going to come.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7d81" name="7d81"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Diversity Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2c6d" name="2c6d">But you are not going to generate a usefully diverse array of diverse ideas in strategy development if the company doesn’t have a diverse group of employees working on the strategy. Workforce diversity won’t happen unless the company has an effective strategy for promoting and nurturing diversity in its workforce, measured in the various ways diversity is typically measured (ethnic, racial, gender, sexual orientation, cultural, educational, religious, geographical, experiential, socioeconomic).</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dfa2" name="dfa2">But workforce diversity on its will not on its own produce the productive benefits of diversity. Productive diversity occurs only when the presence of multiple ideas enables a group to find solutions that are better than the incoming idea of any one member. If it can’t produce that outcome, then diversity won’t beat uniformity — even though it should.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fc2d" name="fc2d">To ensure productive diversity, the diverse group members must be equipped to take advantage of their diversity of thought. That is a non-trivial thing because the modern educational system teaches students to seek ‘the right answer’ in the context of a narrowly defined discipline, and then to defend the validity of their answer. I wish that it wasn’t so, but that is the dominant mode in modern education. Those features are mirrored in business education in which business students are taught to be narrow specialists who understand one knowledge domain and apply their understanding of that singular domain to frame problems and come up with ‘the right answer.’</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="095a" name="095a">This approach trains us — implicitly more than explicitly — to decline to listen to someone in another knowledge domain when we are discussing our own knowledge domain. A marketing person will be quick to say to a manufacturing person: “What do you know about marketing?” Typically, we ask the disciplinary interloper to adopt the logical structure and language system of our knowledge domain to converse with us. And if they don’t agree with us, we are likely to dismiss their views. We are not systematically taught to explore the thinking, the ideas, or the conclusions drawn from a point of view that is fundamentally different than ours, and certainly not to treat it as a precious resource.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dea3" name="dea3">That is why I think there is unease about diversity in corporations. Diversity without tools for gaining the value from diversity isn’t productive. It can, in fact, be a net negative, producing fighting, squabbling and recrimination. That is why diversity strategy needs two foundational elements: diversity itself, plus tools for taking maximum advantage from the inherent bounty of diversity.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5ad2" name="5ad2"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Importance of Integrative Thinking</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5dc4" name="5dc4">The approach to strategy that I discussed above (which I call the Strategic Choice Structuring Process) is a single-purpose tool designed to take the most productive advantage of diversity in developing strategy by encouraging, nurturing, and protecting outlier views. The broader and more generalized tool for facilitating productive diversity is Integrative Thinking. I wrote about it in <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-integrative-thinking-96ac0769709b" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-integrative-thinking-96ac0769709b" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a previous PTW/PI piece</a> and in two books — <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Opposable-Mind-Successful-Integrative-Thinking/dp/1422118924/" href="https://www.amazon.com/Opposable-Mind-Successful-Integrative-Thinking/dp/1422118924/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Opposable Mind</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Great-Choices-Integrative-Thinking/dp/1633692965/" href="https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Great-Choices-Integrative-Thinking/dp/1633692965/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Creating Great Choices</a> (the latter with Jennifer Riel). Integrative Thinking is the foundational tool for creating superior solutions out of models that don’t easily fit with one another — or appear in outright opposition, as is often the case if those models come from dramatically diverse backgrounds or perspectives.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="89ac" name="89ac">Integrative Thinking demonstrates how deeply understanding the functioning of opposing models can facilitate the creative combination of features from each model to produce a new model that contains elements of each but is superior to both. While it may sound intimidatingly difficult, it is in fact utterly doable. My colleagues and I started out teaching Integrative Thinking to MBA and undergraduate business students as well as business executives. But since then, we have now proven that it can be taught to young students across the K-12 spectrum in a program we call <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="http://www.rotmanithink.ca/" href="http://www.rotmanithink.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I-Think</a>.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="79e4" name="79e4">At the heart of Integrative Thinking is what we call a stance: the combination of how you see the world around you and how you see yourself in that world. The single most useful stance for productive diversity that you can hold going into any interaction is: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“I have a view worth hearing, but I might be missing something.” </em>Each element of that stance is important. If you don’t think you have <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">a view worth hearing</em>, you won’t share it and you can’t and won’t add anything to conversations. It is worthless go to a meeting with another person and declare: “I am just here to listen.” You can’t not have a view. Humans automatically do. Yours is worth hearing if you want to contribute to productive diversity.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cda8" name="cda8"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Might</em> is also important. In advance of the other person speaking, you can’t be certain that you are indeed missing something. But <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">might</em> implies genuine openness to the possibility that you are, and that openness is an important prerequisite for productive diversity. Finally, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">be missing something </em>declares to yourself and signals to the other that you want more raw materials with which to work to create a better answer and a dramatically differing point of view is the richest source of those raw materials.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="195a" name="195a"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I have a view worth hearing</em> indicates that you are delighted to provide more raw materials to the other person making the benefits from diversity truly reciprocal. But that person won’t listen if you don’t add <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">but I might be missing something,</em> because nobody wants to think jointly with a know-it-all!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5ea0" name="5ea0">If you adopt the stance <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“I have a view worth hearing, but I might be missing something,” </em>you will be amazed what you and your diverse colleagues can create together.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="27df" name="27df"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="40a3" name="40a3">I encourage everyone to lean into diversity because productive diversity holds the promise of making the world a better place, a place full of breakthrough decisions. It starts with adopting the stance of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I have a view worth hearing, but I might be missing something</em>. You won’t be able to hold it every time — I can’t either and I have been practicing a long time — but the more you do, the more effective you will be. Remind yourself of it before you go into any important meeting. The more you can maintain that stance, the more you will seek out diverse views and work to bring those voices into your organization. That will create an upward spiral of becoming more diverse and utilizing that diversity more productively, and so on.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="9647" name="9647">When developing strategy, create an environment that welcomes and encourages possibilities. Let them be whimsical, even a bit crazy. Don’t allow opining on the merits of possibilities. Only permit asking WWHTBT to gain agreement on the logic of each possibility. Then seek agreement on what aspects of the logic needs testing and how. That will give each possibility a fair chance — which is all that each one deserves and needs, which will enable you and your organization to benefit maximally from diversity in strategy.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

In response, I am dedicating my 45th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece to Compelling Communication for Your Strategy. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c2c3" name="c2c3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Less is More</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dece" name="dece">Generally speaking, the longer the document, the weaker the strategy and the lower the effectiveness of its communication. Strategy is a few key choices. If you can’t readily identify those choices, you don’t have a strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1366" name="1366">To communicate your strategy choices well, you need to leave out a lot. Remember, doing things for which <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/is-the-opposite-of-your-choice-stupid-on-its-face-5b247ffd7f94" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/is-the-opposite-of-your-choice-stupid-on-its-face-5b247ffd7f94" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the opposite is stupid on its face</a> is not strategy. For example, the opposite of caring about customers (i.e., not caring) is stupid on its face. Of course, you should care about customers for the obvious reason that you don’t want to be stupid. But put all of those non-stupid things in a back-up document. It doesn’t mean that they are not important, or you don’t need to invest in them. But listing all the things that you are going to do that any non-stupid participant in your Where-to-Play (WTP) would do simply muddles the effective communication of your strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e21b" name="e21b">Your true strategy is limited to the choices you have made that enable you to be distinctive relative to your competitors. Those choices are likely to be few in number. If there are lots, it probably means that it isn’t a precise strategy. These choices can involve a distinctive WTP and/or a distinctive How-to-Win (HTW), backed by distinctive (or distinctive level of investment in) Must-Have Capabilities (MHC) and Enabling Management Systems (EMS). Plus, it includes the Winning Aspiration which motivates those choices, as well as specifying the outcomes that you expect to result from the strategy choices.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="146a" name="146a">That is all you need. If it is more than five pages, it is very likely to be a bad strategy. If it is 100 pages, I wouldn’t even bother to read it and instead would start from scratch on creating a new one. And one page is even better than five pages. Less is more when it comes to specifying and communicating your strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="be77" name="be77"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Picture is Worth 1,000 Words</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="73c9" name="73c9">While I have nothing to offer that is as visually brilliant as the Minard map, I do recommend communicating strategy in pictures either instead of or as a supplement to a textual description. My favorite communication tool for strategy is a combination of text and picture — the strategy choice cascade. Below is the cascade for the strategic transformation of Oil of Olay, a slowly growing $750 million brand that ranked outside the top five skin care brands as of the late 1990s, into Olay, which grew in the decade of the 2000’s to the number one skin care brand in the world, a $2.5 billion powerhouse. It is an old example, but because the Olay strategy underwent another iteration in 2015, I can safely use the 1999 strategy as an illustration.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="e68d" name="e68d"><img class="graf-image" data-height="480" data-image-id="1*wNGy_rz9tdmHRsXpMQe7cg.gif" data-width="853" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wNGy_rz9tdmHRsXpMQe7cg.gif"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin, 2021</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="5c4f" name="5c4f">It specifies the few things that really matter and are distinctive, while leaving out the things that don’t/aren’t. For example, the WTP targets women aged 25–49 noticing the first signs of aging rather than the 50+ segment on which the industry focused. On its own, the choice of mass channels (i.e., food, drug, mass merchandisers) is not unique. Numerous competitors distribute through the mass channels while numerous others distribute through the prestige channel (i.e., department stores and specialty beauty stores like Sephora). However, in combination with the WTP, it is distinctive. The Olay strategy involved winning by creating a ‘masstige’ positioning that combined the best of the mass channel experience (convenience and absence of pushy salespeople) and prestige channel experience (higher quality products, better packaging, more product information) in the mass channel. And it was positioned at a price point unheard of in the mass channel — the price for the initial Olay Total Effects product was $18.99 when the highest previous mass channel price would have been $4.99. Eventually Olay would hit the $50 price point for its top-of-the-line Olay Pro-X.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1244" name="1244">In terms of MHC, the masstige concept required substantial investment by the retailers to create an experience that felt similar to the prestige channel. Convincing the retailers to invest in this way leveraged off P&amp;G’s historically strong retailer relationships but required P&amp;G to invest further in its capabilities to partner/co-invest with its retailers. It also required capabilities unique to mass channel players in influencer marketing. That is, to succeed at the near-prestige price point, P&amp;G had to learn how to work with beauty magazine editors to encourage favorable reviews of the new Olay line-up. And it needed to increase its investment in skin care R&amp;D to industry-leading levels. Finally, in EMS, it had to develop new systems for co-investing with retailers on creating the prestige-like environment in their mass stores, which involved higher levels of trade spending than P&amp;G’s traditional systems would have allowed.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5e4b" name="5e4b">In addition to this one-page graphical presentation of strategy, I also like one particular visualization for each of WTP and HTW.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f2d9" name="f2d9">A generic version of the WTP visualization is below:</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="8dfd" name="8dfd"><img class="graf-image" data-height="480" data-image-id="1*btYhbXCcG3BM_M3SsOn6Fg.gif" data-width="853" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*btYhbXCcG3BM_M3SsOn6Fg.gif"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin, 2021</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="2d4a" name="2d4a">Think of two axes that best describe your WTP choice. It could be geography &amp; price point, or distribution channel &amp; customer size, or, for Olay, age demographic &amp; price point. Then show where you and your most important competitors are positioned. The smaller the overlap, the better for your strategy. If you have chosen the identical WTP as one or more competitors, it will be harder to have a distinctive HTW — not impossible, just a lot harder. If you have chosen different WTP, it is easier to find a distinctive HTW. In addition, the intensity of competition is going to be lower.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fe1b" name="fe1b">Let me use two contrasting P&amp;G examples to illustrate. When P&amp;G entered the orange juice business with Citrus Hill in 1982, orange juice was a great category. The two dominant players were Coca Cola subsidiary, Minute Maid, which sold mainly frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ), and Beatrice (and later Seagram and later still PepsiCo) subsidiary, Tropicana, which exclusively sold whole juice. Those choices produced a small overlap between the competitors. If a consumer wanted FCOJ it bought Minute Maid and if whole, it bought Tropicana. P&amp;G entered with a WTP directly on top of Minute Maid with Citrus Hill FCOJ. P&amp;G thought it had a strong enough HTW — a proprietary way to enrich orange juice with a calcium level as high as found in the most commonly-used source for calcium — milk. However, its entry as another FCOJ player precipitated a brutal war with Minute Maid, which, by starting to offer whole juice, had already heated up the competition with Tropicana. Citrus Hill could never overcome Minute Maid’s huge scale advantage with both retailers and consumers and P&amp;G exited the business in 1992 without ever having turned a profit.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b7a9" name="b7a9">Contrast that with Pringles, which P&amp;G launched in 1968 into the potato chip business which was and still is dominated by PepsiCo subsidiary, Frito-Lay. However, Frito-Lay’s WTP was whole chips delivered by way of direct store delivery (called DSD). Because of the fragility of bags of potato chips, Frito-Lay drivers deliver to each individual store rather than to a central warehouse and place the bags on the store shelves themselves, an extremely expensive form of delivery for which Frito-Lay has dominant scale. Pringles was engineered to have the least possible overlap with Frito-Lay’s WTP. It was a reconstituted chip, engineered to stack efficiently and safely in a can that was robust enough to go through traditional and much cheaper warehouse distribution. As a result, Pringles and Frito-Lay co-existed happily and profitably for decades until P&amp;G sold Pringles to Kellogg for $2.7 billion in 2012 as part of its exit from all food businesses.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="55e5" name="55e5">I find that this visualization of WTP helps push me to think of ways to create greater separation in WTP from my major competitors, and if that is not possible, to make sure that I have a HTW that will really win against a competitor in the identical WTP. Plus it provides a clear snapshot of my strategy versus those of competitors.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="32a4" name="32a4">That leads to my favorite HTW visualization.</p><figure class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p" id="dbd3" name="dbd3"><img class="graf-image" data-height="480" data-image-id="1*jkJ4dOJxQs_h4cfOVilhpQ.gif" data-width="853" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jkJ4dOJxQs_h4cfOVilhpQ.gif"/><figcaption class="imageCaption">Copyright: Roger L. Martin, 2021</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="c148" name="c148">I always want to be able to characterize my strategy versus competitors on this chart. Am I able to charge more than industry average as a differentiator — which would put my strategy in one of the two right-side bars? If so, have I been able to keep my costs at a level consistent with industry averages — which would put my strategy in the winning bar the farthest right?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="47c5" name="47c5">Alternatively, do I have appreciably lower costs than industry average as a low-cost player — which would put my strategy in one of the two left-side bars? If so, have I been able to keep my value/quality at a level consistent with industry averages — which would put my strategy in the other winning bar the farthest left?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f7ed" name="f7ed">I find this to be a helpful visualization because if I am one of the four middle bars, it signals that I am playing to play not playing to win. None of those middle bars is a rewarding place to be. It is all hard work and no reward as the players at both ends who are playing to win have the ability to jerk me around like a puppet on a string. It signals that it should be back to square one for strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="95d2" name="95d2"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="29b7" name="29b7">If you are on the receiving end of strategy, be extremely wary of long documents. If strategy can’t be summarized one page and described thoroughly in five, it is probably a plan not a strategy. As I have argued previously, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-vs-planning-complements-not-substitutes-ea08e56809d6" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/strategy-vs-planning-complements-not-substitutes-ea08e56809d6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a plan is a useful complement to strategy</a>, but it is not a substitute for strategy. If it runs many pages, it is almost certainly <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/from-laudable-list-to-how-to-really-win-6aa20498e89" href="https://rogermartin.medium.com/from-laudable-list-to-how-to-really-win-6aa20498e89" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a laudable list of non-stupid actions</a> that do not guarantee or even make it likely that you will win. That is the classic strategy trap of a plan masquerading as a strategy. As a consequence, you likely need to start from scratch or nearly scratch on developing a real strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="83b3" name="83b3">If you are presenting a strategy that you can’t summarize in one page and describe thoroughly in five, chances are you haven’t thought hard enough about your strategy choices. Use your inability to communicate your strategy succinctly as a spur to focus on determining what distinctive choices across the strategy choice cascade that you have made and what others you need to make. To test those choices, create the above pictures of WTP and HTW to determine whether that WTP/HTW combination is truly distinctive relative to competition. If it not distinctive, go back to work until it is a truly compelling strategy. And you will know when it is because you will be able to communicate it in a single cascade chart as with Olay!</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Martin, 2021</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="978d" name="978d">I find there is much uncertainty and even confusion over the role of the Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) in the modern company. It is not entirely surprising in that it is a relatively new role — compared for instance with Chief Financial Officer. Business strategy as a thing has only been around since the 1960s and CSOs have only appeared broadly in organization charts over the past twenty years. The modern C<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">x</em>O convention tends to imply that the person with the role is responsible for doing/performing whatever the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">x</em> specifies. So, the CFO does the finance and accounting of the company. The CLO does the legal work. But the CSO role is a bit more subtle and nuanced than that, which is why I am dedicating my 46th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece to The Proper Role of the Chief Strategy Officer: It Isn’t Doing Strategy. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a313" name="a313"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Strategy is a Line Responsibility</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="af18" name="af18">In my experience, the confusion stems principally from strategy being seen as a staff rather than line responsibility. This is unsurprising in that the company that was most critical to the rise of the strategy function, the then-iconic General Electric (GE), treated it as a staff responsibility for the better part of two decades. Under CEOs Fred Borch (1963–1972) and Reginald Jones (1972–1981), GE built a huge strategy function, with hundreds of budding strategists, that set strategy for the company and its businesses. By the time Jack Welch succeeded Jones, the function had become sufficiently unpopular with line managers that Welch downsized and downgraded it. But because in those days and indeed up until the relatively recent past, GE was seen as a paragon of management, the legacy of Borch and Jones left a broad and long shadow across management practice.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cd88" name="cd88">Vestiges of that era remain, which holds that you can’t leave strategy to regular managers: you need super-smart specialists to do strategy. It is arguably perpetuated by the now-gigantic strategy consulting firms who are hired by line management to do strategy for them, because they are, of course, super-smart and some of them even specialize in strategy. The notion is buttressed by the analogy to other C<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">x</em>Os. You need a JD to do the legal work as CLO. You need a CPA to do the financial work as the CFO. You need an electrical or computer engineering degree to do the IT work as CIO. While they don’t do it in complete isolation, the CLO is expected to come to the CEO with a recommendation as to how to handle the important legal matters, similarly for the CFO on, say, a debt financing decision, and the CIO on, say, the choice of ERP system. It follows logically that the strategy specialist CSO should do the strategy work of the corporation and present it to the CEO for ratification because it is a staff function like the rest of the staff functions.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9620" name="9620">The problem is that it is not. Strategy is not the job of the specialist. It is the job of the General Manager (GM) of the business in question, whether that GM is a CEO, Business Unit President, Product Line President, or even Brand or Product Manager. It is the GM’s job to make the few key high-level choices that define the Where-to-Play and How-to-Win (WTP/HTW). I don’t particularly care whether it is called strategy. Many entrepreneurs deny to me that they have a strategy — claiming it is ‘too theoretical’ for them. But their strategy is revealed in the choices that they very consciously make. If I ask entrepreneurs why not change the product line or the store layout or the website, they will fiercely defend the current choice. That it because it is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">their</em> strategy — not what any strategy specialist told them to do.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e5a7" name="e5a7">But I do care that the WTP/HTW choices are made and are made both consciously and well. That is the singularly most important job of the GM — at every GM level from the lowest product or brand manager to the CEO. If they don’t make those choices well, their organizations will have a miserable future — working extra hard to make up for their GM’s poor choices but still never winning. If the GM doesn’t make those choices and instead outsources them to somebody either within or outside the organization, then that executive is not really the GM of the business in question. There is a shadow GM doing the supposed GM’s job. That situation should be fixed by getting a new GM who embraces the GM’s true job.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9ce7" name="9ce7">If the job of the CSO is not to make the strategy choices for the business, then does the CSO have a real job? Very much so! There are three critical jobs that the CSO can and should play: facilitate the creation of strategy, coordinate the creation of strategy, and ensure the consistency of strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="078f" name="078f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Facilitate the Creation of Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8416" name="8416">I feel that strategy is becoming a lost art. Over the past half-century, two of the biggest sources of executive management have been MBA graduates and the alumni of the strategy consulting firms. But modern-day business school strategy courses mainly teach a slew of analytical strategy frameworks, and increasingly theoretical ones at that, not how to create a strategy. And today the large strategy consulting firms, do much more work completely outside the domain of strategy (e.g., post-merger integration, overhead cost reduction, sales force reorganization, logistics optimization, benchmarking, project management, etc.) than in strategy. Consequently, there is short supply of executives well-schooled in strategy, meaning that many of today’s GMs need support in performing this critical part of their job.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b8b1" name="b8b1">In the modern world, it takes a lot of motivation and a big investment of time to learn strategy on your own. As a result, CSOs who have invested heavily in becoming skilled experts in strategy can play a hugely positive, if not essential role in helping their CEOs by facilitating the process of creating that strategy. Note, this is not doing strategy as a CFO would create the financial statements and present them to the CEO for approval. It is helping CEOs work through the exercise of getting to the point of making their fundamental strategy choices.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8cd1" name="8cd1"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Coordinate the Creation of Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6d33" name="6d33">It is a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://hbr.org/2010/07/the-execution-trap" href="https://hbr.org/2010/07/the-execution-trap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">modern business fallacy</a> that strategy happens at the top of the organization and everything else is execution. Strategy choice happens at all levels of the corporation. It happens at the corporate level. If the corporation has business units — and most large ones do — each business unit needs a strategy. If business units have product lines, each needs a strategy. PepsiCo has a strategy. Its Frito-Lay business unit has a strategy. And Frito-Lay’s Doritos product line has a strategy. The CEO of PepsiCo is too far away to specify the strategy for Doritos. Similarly, the CEO of GE can’t specify the strategy for the jet engine maintenance business.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9af2" name="9af2">Consequently, in any sizable corporation, coordination is a huge challenge for strategy — a challenge that in my experience is typically not well-handled. A CSO can add enormous value by ensuring that strategy choice-making happens and happens well at all levels of the organization. This entails ensuring that all GMs across the organization have the strategy support necessary to make their choices.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="da5e" name="da5e">Further, for the corporation to be successful, all those choices must be made in a way that they fit together and reinforce one another. That most assuredly doesn’t happen on its own. The only person in a good position to create and oversee a management process for coordinating across all these strategy choices is the CSO.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="13c4" name="13c4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ensure the Consistency of Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0a43" name="0a43">Finally, the CSO has an important job in ensuring the consistency of strategy across the organization by installing a common language for strategy. I wouldn’t have had this third element on my list a decade ago, but my experiences in working with this era’s large corporations has caused me to appreciate the power of consistency of strategy. Large corporations often have multiple consulting firms working in its various parts on a variety of things. Each consulting firm has its own language system for strategy. Plus, the members of the strategy functions bring myriad language systems from their MBA education and/or work experiences. The result is that strategy becomes a proverbial Tower of Babel. It makes challenging if not nearly impossible the CSO task of coordinating strategy across the corporation on behalf of the CEO.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f27f" name="f27f">What I now believe — and wouldn’t have ten years ago — is that the CSO needs to install a single language for strategy in the company. It is not unlike the CIO deciding that the company is going to run Windows, not Linux, on all the corporation’s servers, or the CFO deciding that the company is going to use FIFO versus LIFO for inventory valuation across all business units. While I have my favorite in terms of a language for strategy, the more important thing is that every corporation adopt a single language system for strategy so that the CSO can ensure the consistent facilitation and coordination of strategy choices across the corporation.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="39e8" name="39e8"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="334a" name="334a">If you are a CSO and you want to do strategy — i.e., make your company’s key strategic choices — you are in the wrong job. Get a GM job at whatever level is feasible for you now and work your way up the GM ladder.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="13cb" name="13cb">If your CEO asks you to come up with a strategy for him or her, get a new job. You shouldn’t be working for anyone who doesn’t want to do their most important job.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="4199" name="4199">Set your goal as enhancing the quality of all the strategy choices that happen around you. You and your strategy function colleagues help GMs throughout the company consider and make the strategy choices that need to be made. You orchestrate the strategy choice-making across the company to ensure the greatest level of fit and reinforcement among the strategy choices. And you install a language system for strategy that enables everyone to converse effectively on strategy, which will especially help your boss, the CEO, understand every GM’s strategy and how they can be made to fit together optimally. Together, these elements comprise a worthy, valuable, and exciting role for the Chief Strategy Officer.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

I think the framing of the question as whether to listen to customers is not helpful and that is why I am writing my 47th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece on Should We Listen to Customers: You Need to Ask a Better Question. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="877e" name="877e"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Source of the Question</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7956" name="7956">The question arises because of the provocative statements of two of America’s greatest all time business leaders and game changers, Henry Ford and Steve Jobs.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1f92" name="1f92">Ford is reputed to have said: “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.</em>” Interestingly, there is no evidence that he ever mouthed or wrote those words, but it has been repeated so many times that people generally believe that he must have. (Parenthetically, it is like Peter Drucker’s “culture eats strategy for lunch.” Despite extensive forensic work by Drucker archivists, there is not a shred of evidence he ever said or wrote that phrase, but because people think the great business philosopher did, they assume culture must indeed eat strategy for lunch.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b5fa" name="b5fa">And Jobs really said both “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">It sounds logical to ask customers what they want and then give it to them. But they rarely wind up getting what they really want that way</em>” and “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.</em>”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b57d" name="b57d">These pointed views from legendary company-builders on the dangers of listening to customers have caused people to wonder and speculate about the merits of listening to customers. And the concern has been exacerbated, I believe, by the revelation that some of the most beloved customer research techniques have been found utterly wanting. For example, the only thing that focus groups will reliably determine is what the members of the focus group think that the focus group leader wants them to say. And many products or services that pass a statistically significant customer research test fail when they are brought to the market in which the research was performed. Plus, the modern critique is: Why perform customer research on a sample to predict behavior when you can just do A/B testing and do what they respond better to, even if you have no idea why they did?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e043" name="e043"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">We Need a Better Question</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2ef7" name="2ef7">I believe we need a better question than: should we listen to customers? And we need a better answer than: just do A/B testing.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9302" name="9302">I start from the premise that every successful product/service derives from insights about customers. Ford’s insights about the working-class Americans he wanted to serve helped him determine that it was necessary to offer them a car in any color they wanted as long as it was black in order to hit the price point necessary to make the car widely affordable. And Jobs famously had powerful insights about the needs, wants, and motivations of computer and personal electronics users — not to mention animated movie watchers. And while the inventions behind Teflon, Penicillin, Post-It Notes and Viagra were acknowledged customer-insight-free accidents, the decision to invest in what turned out to be successful commercialization was based on powerful customer insights. Otherwise, these inventions would have never made it out of the lab.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="47f3" name="47f3">To me, the more useful question is: What particular customer insights would equip you to make the decisions you seek to make? The answer to that question will inform in what way, you should ‘listen to customers.’ That is because you need to employ a technique for acquiring those insights that is consistent with the nature of the insight you are seeking.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4c92" name="4c92"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">What Customers Are Doing</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cf66" name="cf66">If you seek to hone and refine what you are currently offering, then A/B test and adjust accordingly. You don’t have to understand why customers react the way they do, just that they do more of what you want. That is a form of listening, although ‘watching’ might be a more accurate description.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5605" name="5605"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">What Customers Have Done</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cef6" name="cef6">If you are trying understand what customers have already done, you can use quantitative sampling techniques for listening. You can ask, where have you shopped for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">x? </em>Or are you aware of brand <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">y</em>? And if so, have you purchased it in the past? However, this methodology assumes truthfulness and self-awareness, both of which are at best tenuous assumptions.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6e64" name="6e64">An additional limitation of this technique is that the questions must be sufficiently simplistic for the answers to be added up and assessed quantitatively. You can’t ask how you felt when you bought <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">x</em>, unless you specify the (say) five categories of feeling into which they need to wedge their answer — which you can guarantee is not how they actually felt but only an approximation. The attraction is that you can add the answers up and make a statistical inference about the answers. The downside is that the statistically significant answers may well be stupid. The bottom line is that you can’t ask a simplistic question, which you must do with a quantitative instrument, while expecting a profound answer.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a9ab" name="a9ab"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">What Customers Might Do</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ae5d" name="ae5d">If you attempt to ask a sophisticated question, such as whether you would buy this new thing that you haven’t seen before, there is an even bigger problem. Customers can’t give you accurate feedback because they don’t know the true answer. But when you ask, they will give you an answer and typically will express confidence about it. From his comments, it appears Jobs was particularly worried about this problem. Customers don’t know the answer that you would need from them in order to make your decision. So don’t ask them a question that they can’t answer. And for sure don’t ask it in a quantitative survey.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="278d" name="278d">If you need insights about customers’ likely reaction to an offering that they haven’t yet experienced, the best way is for the person who desires customer insight to interact directly with potential customers from whom the insights need to be extracted. That means interacting personally without an intermediary. The quality and utility of the interpretation is based on the skills and capabilities of the interpreter. The task of gaining useful customer insights in this context is tough enough already without playing proverbial ‘telephone’ through intermediaries, such as market research firms. That is why I prefer 10 in-person interactions between the customer and the business decisionmaker (e.g., CEO) than a rigorously designed 10,000-person customer survey. The latter puts too many unhelpful filters between the decisionmaker and the customer.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="be91" name="be91">The task in this situation is to build a model of customers by interacting with them, both watching them and asking them questions about what you see them do. It will be a profoundly imperfect model. But it is a model of how they think, what they care about, what annoys them, what makes them happy. All the customer savants that I have met habitually build a model of their customer which they use to make their bets. When I ask them, they can readily explain the bets they make based on their model of the customer. They learn continuously by watching how their bets play out and updating their model accordingly — what a nerd would call Bayesian updating.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c285" name="c285">The very best figure out how to make little bets in order to learn along the way. Four Seasons Hotels founder Isadore Sharp didn’t bet the entire chain on what became ‘the Four Seasons Model.’ He built a model of luxury hotel guests by speaking directly with and watching them in action, which he used to create the chain’s legendary London Park Lane hotel. Only when he was able to observe its huge success did he use it as the model for every other new Four Seasons hotel.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1b9b" name="1b9b">This also reinforces a brilliance of iterative prototyping, an aspect of the design thinking movement that was popularized by David Kelley and Bill Moggeridge of IDEO. Iterative prototyping gave them progressively clearer insights about what customers will actually do by exposing them multiple rounds of increasingly higher resolution prototypes. This form of insight allows model improvement by way of repeated Bayesian updating.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2124" name="2124"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">What Customers Might Want</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3f0f" name="3f0f">Yet another kind of desired insight from customers is an idea for a new product or service. Both Ford and Jobs express considerable pessimism about the ability to get that sort of insight from customers. Here I partially agree and partially not.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="34f3" name="34f3">I agree in that developing an idea for a new product/service is your job, not theirs. Customers typically don’t have motivation for investing the time necessary to dream up a new offering to meet their needs. Plus they often lack the required skills, such as expertise in the technology involved or manufacturing/service design experience. Consequently, I would never survey customers to find out what new product/service they would imagine or favor. On average, customers won’t provide interesting or valuable answers to that question.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6813" name="6813">That having been said, while you shouldn’t want the views of a statistically significant sample of customers because the vast majority will not have invested enough time and thought into the question, the outliers can be interesting. Sourcing a new idea is a bit like finding a buyer for your house. It doesn’t matter what the median potential buyer of your house thinks it is worth. What really matters is the one buyer who absolutely loves your house. Similarly, what matters is the one fabulous new-product idea. That is why I like the idea of listening to customers by way of crowdsourcing as one source of new ideas. It doesn’t matter that the vast majority of the ideas aren’t of any value. Only a tiny few ideas need to be any good for crowdsourcing to be a winning tool. That is why I like customer crowdsourcing platforms like Lego Ideas. I wouldn’t ever count on this technique for all my new product/service ideas, but I would certainly utilize it as one tool.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fdd2" name="fdd2"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4b22" name="4b22">When developing strategy, you should listen to customers but the techniques you use to pay attention must vary depending on what you are seeking to accomplish. Think of your task as carefully matching the insight sought to the technique used.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="fdc3" name="fdc3">If you are honing and refining and don’t care why, then listen by way of A/B testing. If you are trying to understand prior behaviors, listen by way of quantitative sampling. If you are trying to predict future actions, observe customers yourself — not through intermediaries — to build a model and then figure out how to make bets to test and refine your customer model. If you are trying to come up with a new offering, supplement observing and modeling customers by crowdsourcing ideas from them.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

So, I have decided to write my 48th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) on Strategy &amp; Boards of Directors: It’s About the When &amp; the What. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c763" name="c763"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Nature of the Frustration</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="32a3" name="32a3">On most modern board calendars, there is a strategy day. I know this because I have been to innumerable such days as a board member, facilitator, or advisor. I would argue that if the board members and the executives who attend were to answer honestly, they would find it hard to give these strategy days a positive review. There are positive exceptions to the rule to be sure, but most are somewhere in the B- to D+ range.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4b06" name="4b06">The main critiques are strikingly consistent. From executive management, it is that boards engage more in nitpicking rather than in adding real value. From board members, it is that executive management comes to the day with a fixed point of view and doesn’t really want the discussion and dialogue that they claim to desire.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6fd5" name="6fd5"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Set up for Disappointment</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2264" name="2264">In many respects, the board’s role in strategy is set up for disappointment, making success the exception not the rule. There are two overarching problems.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1adc" name="1adc">First, there is typically unhelpful confusion over who is in charge of strategy? Is it the CEO/executive management? Well sort of because the CEO is the chief executive officer. Getting strategy right is one of the most if not the most important executive responsibility of the CEO. But isn’t the board the boss? Isn’t getting strategy right one of the most if not the most important task for the board to ensure on behalf of shareholders? So, shouldn’t the board be in charge?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5323" name="5323">Second, the stakes for strategy days are too high. Regardless of how much discussion these days are supposed to entail, they aren’t set up for real discussion even though all strategy day agendas officially include time for discussion. Management typically spends a staggering amount of time and effort getting ready for its strategy day. Because meeting with the board on strategy is so important, management wants to make its preparatory work as perfect as possible to look and feel great in front of its all-powerful board. What would signal to management that it is indeed as perfect as possible? It would be for the board to pat management on the back for a perfect job. When the board instead asks probing questions or suggests alternative ways to look at the situation, it is a disappointment to management. It feels like nitpicking. It is very hard for management to hide its disappointment and take on the thoughts, advice, and pushback of the board. As a result, the board feels that management doesn’t really want a discussion.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4af9" name="4af9">Both end up disappointed because both have been set up for its likelihood. And the reaction tends not to be helpful. At the next strategy day, management tries to be more perfect still — which makes it even less enthused about feedback — and the board tries to insist on more dialogue/discussion — which makes management feel still more nitpicked.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b6af" name="b6af"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Better When and What</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6be7" name="6be7">The solution lies in having a better <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">when</em> and more nuanced <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what</em>.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="271c" name="271c">The key to a better <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">when</em> is to ban the strategy day and instead have multiple touch points with the board on strategy. You can’t in a single day get board and management together on strategy in a productive way. Holding a single day after management has done all its thinking just sets board and management up for the above dynamic. Alternatively holding the single day up front just produces brainstorming/visioning sessions that tend to leave board members frustrated. It would be tough enough to get one group to coalesce productively on strategy during a single day offsite. But two groups? The probability is tiny.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bbf2" name="bbf2">Three times is a better idea that sets board and management up for success.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2a46" name="2a46"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The First When &amp; What</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="81be" name="81be">The first <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">when</em> should be at the inception of the strategy process and the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what</em> should be board input on the problem to be solved. As I have argued <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://roger-78069.medium.com/strategy-as-problem-solving-5c6fb9291d87" href="https://roger-78069.medium.com/strategy-as-problem-solving-5c6fb9291d87" rel="noopener" target="_blank">earlier in the PTW/PI series</a>, strategy is a problem-solving exercise. Strategy is most frustrating and least useful when it is done because it is that time of year on the annual cycle. Strategy should make choices designed to cause the key problems of the organization go away.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="906f" name="906f">On this front, I believe that the great American pragmatist philosopher, John Dewey, was right: a problem well put is half solved. Framing the problem is an important and high-leverage time for the board’s input. The board has a big stake in making sure that management heads off to work on the most important problems to be solved. Having that up-front dialogue creates positive alignment. It enables management to work on a strategy agenda that the board cares about. This avoids a big problem that I see at strategy days. Not infrequently the board judges management to have done high-quality work but sadly not on the issues that the board feels are most important. That just serves to discourage management and lower the confidence of the board.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d4bb" name="d4bb">This problem can be avoided entirely by having an upfront conversation between management and the board on the key strategy problems they wish to solve. Management should come to the meeting with the problems it thinks are most critical but be very open to getting input from the board that hones and refines the problems and their framing. It is easier for management to be open to ideas at this point because it hasn’t invested a huge amount of work in the answer.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="48e0" name="48e0"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Second When &amp; What</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5818" name="5818">The second <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">when</em> should be in the middle of the process and the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what</em> should focus on exposing the board to the strategy possibilities — the alternative approaches with which management has come up to address the problem(s) laid out in the first session. At this stage, I favor carrying out three steps of the Strategic Choice Structuring Process (pictured above) with the board: 1) laying out the strategy possibilities; 2) providing the logic of what would have to be true (WWHTBT) for each possibility; and 3) identifying the barriers to choice (the WWHTBT that management is least confident are true for each possibility).</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c254" name="c254">This serves to lay out the interim logic of management and enables management to receive valuable feedback from the board before doing all sorts of analytical work, research, and study — and getting wedded to one particular answer. Management should ask the board whether it feels that the possibilities address the agreed upon problem(s) and find out now, not when it is too late, whether the board is allergic to any of the possibilities, and/or if board members have additional possibilities to add to management’s list. In addition, management can edit and enhance the WWHTBT based on board feedback and align on the barriers to choice that must be tested for management and the board to feel confident in choosing one of the possibilities.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="42e4" name="42e4">This feedback enables management to work on possibilities about which the board is interested and enthused, and to design tests of those possibilities that will be compelling to the board when the results come back.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="57ee" name="57ee"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Third When &amp; What</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b098" name="b098">The third<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> when</em> comes at the end of the process when management comes forward with its recommended strategy choice and the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what</em> is board approval. But unlike at a one-time strategy day, the board is ready for it. It knows that management has been working on the problem(s) board and management have agreed is (are) the most important. And that management has been studying strategy possibilities that board and management think are most promising. And that management has been doing tests on the aspects that board and management agree are most uncertain.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c8c0" name="c8c0">All the board needs at this point is to see how the results of the barrier tests and management’s recommendation and plan. The board is ready to agree with management because it has been intimately involved in the thinking process along the way. At this point, its feedback will be on nuances that management will be inclined to accept — because they have been thinking about the whole thing together.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="42cd" name="42cd"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insight</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4c1d" name="4c1d">Don’t fight about getting to an answer of the first question: who’s in charge of strategy? This approach obviates the need for an answer because the board and executive management work together in a productive way that both makes the answer irrelevant and hard to determine. One could make an argument that in the above process executive management was ‘in charge’ and an equally strong argument that the board was ‘in charge.’ But who cares? It doesn’t matter when the output is a great strategy in which board and management have confidence.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="33e8" name="33e8">Eliminate your board strategy day. It is designed to make success a very low probability. Expand from one to three the key interactions between board and management on strategy. Frame together the problem to be solved. Seek board advice and input on the strategic logic of your strategy possibilities in the middle of the process. And expect a positive reaction from a constructively involved board at the end!</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

While at one level, it’s an obscure academic battle, it has spilled over into the real world with challenging implications for all practitioners of strategy. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f671" name="f671"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">History of the Battle</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a740" name="a740">It is helpful to understand a bit about the history of business strategy to understand the current battle. The first seminal figure in business strategy was not an academic. It was Bruce Henderson, a long-time Westinghouse executive who went on to found the world’s first strategy consulting firm, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in 1963. He wrote extensively about business strategy from outside the academy in the 1960s and 1970s and brought influential concepts such as the growth-share matrix and the experience curve to the nascent field of business strategy. Thanks largely to Henderson and other consulting colleagues, in the 1960s and 1970s, thinking on strategy was led from outside the academy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="396f" name="396f">But more germane to this discussion is the second seminal figure in business strategy, Harvard Business School (HBS) professor Michael Porter who published <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Strategy-Techniques-Industries-Competitors/dp/0684841487/" href="https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Strategy-Techniques-Industries-Competitors/dp/0684841487/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Competitive Strategy</em></a> in 1980, which introduced the world to the five forces model and generic strategies. It became the first ever best-seller in the business category, paving the way for others like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">In Search of Excellence</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Good to Great</em>. The book’s unprecedented success made Porter a certified guru across the business world. However, as an academic writing a business best seller that was read widely outside his academic community, he committed the unforgivable academic sin of addressing himself to non-academics.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8395" name="8395">The academy struck back in the way that it classically does. It caricatured his theories and proposed an alternative theory around which it closed academic ranks. These business academics cast Porter as the father of “the positioning school” (TPS), which they claimed held that all you need to do is use the five forces model to find a structurally attractive industry and then position yourself in that industry to statically exploit the high profitability that it affords you. Their alternative theory, “the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm,” (<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="http://web.mit.edu/bwerner/www/papers/AResource-BasedViewoftheFirm.pdf" href="http://web.mit.edu/bwerner/www/papers/AResource-BasedViewoftheFirm.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first articulated</a> in 1984 by Berger Wernerfelt and later by Jay Barney, both of whom dutifully speak exclusively to other academics) holds that in the modern, fast changing business world, the static TPS approach is bankrupt and that the key to strategy is to accumulate resources which must be Valuable, Rare, Inimitable, and Non-substitutable (hence RBV’s VRIN model — sometimes modified to VRIO by replacing “Non-substitutable resources” with “Organized to exploit”).</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1343" name="1343">The important thing for the outside world to understand is that within the academy, RBV dominates. In most of America’s top 50 business schools, you would have a better shot of getting a tenure stream position in strategy if you revealed you were a convicted felon than if you admitted that you don’t subscribe to RBV. In those schools, strategy students are routinely taught TPS as an example of a deeply flawed theory, especially in comparison to the far superior RBV. As an example of RBV’s academic control, even though I was Dean of Rotman School for 15 years, and quite a powerful one due to the success of the School under my tenure, I was never permitted by those in charge of Strategic Management to teach a strategy course in the MBA/EMBA program based on my approach, one which doesn’t pay the requisite homage to RBV!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1d82" name="1d82"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Silliness of the Battle</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ceee" name="ceee">The fundamental problem with the battle is that it is silly. Every time RBV aficionados explain to me how Porter/TPS says that industries are stable, and that a company should just find a structurally attractive one and mint money in it for all time, I ask them to show me where in Porter’s writing he suggests that. They tend to cavil at the question claiming that everyone knows he says that. It is a classic case of if you repeat a lie enough times, it becomes the truth. Never has an RBV aficionado been able to come up with anything that remotely supports their contention about Porter — though most act as if that doesn’t change anything.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e81d" name="e81d">And whenever I consider RBV, it is hard for me to see past the tautological structure of this purported strategy model. It holds that you should invest in resources that are valuable but from what I can discern from the writings on the model, the only way to ascertain that a resource is valuable is that it that after you have invested in it, the resource becomes valuable. That is, there is no other definition of ‘valuable’ other than ‘valuable.’ Then, the resources should be rare. I guess that explains why a bunch of families got super-rich by gaining control over water rights for arid south and central California where freshwater is rare while nobody has gotten rich gaining control over water rights in Southern Ontario, which is flanked by three of the largest bodies of fresh water in the world (Lakes Huron, Erie, and Ontario) making freshwater very plentiful. Thus, it would appear to me that ‘rare’ is simply a feature of ‘valuable.’ Similarly, ‘inimitable’ is a feature of ‘rare’ because inimitability makes rare things rarer and thus more ‘valuable,’ and likewise for ‘non-substitutable.’</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2c87" name="2c87">Net, RBV says that strategy entails investing in resources that are valuable by being rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable. And you would know that they will be valuable resources because they will be valuable. This of course is true in the same way that Karl Popper points out that the theory of survival of the fittest is always true because the model’s definition of ‘fittest’ is those species that survive. That tautology notwithstanding, business students are generally taught that RBV is correct and TPS is just plain wrong.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2d0a" name="2d0a">But the answer is not that one is wrong and the other is right. Both address critical pieces of the strategy puzzle. Of course, positioning matters. As the water example illustrates with a geographically defined <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">where</em>, the identical resource, water rights, has a completely different impact and value in California versus Ontario. Devoid of a theory of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">where</em>, RBV is a useless construct. But similarly, any theory of positioning is useless without consideration of the capabilities a firm needs to possess to compete successfully in the chosen <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">where</em>. (Porter, by the way, has extensive discussion of capabilities in his strategy work — though this is ignored by TPS critics who want to frame and win an either/or battle.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8501" name="8501">I try to ignore the battle and recognize explicitly that strategy clearly has both <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">positioning</em> aspects and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">resource</em> aspects. Good strategy needs to bridge both and have a unified theory of how to link them, which is what I do with the Strategy Choice Cascade. The second box, Where to Play (WTP), deals explicitly with <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">positioning</em> and makes it clear that a company’s strategy choice needs to specify a place (whether product type, customer set, geography, price tier, etc.) that it will compete. The fourth box, Must-Have Capabilities (MHC), deals explicitly with the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">resources</em> that must be in place for the strategy to have its desired effect. (Parenthetically, the fifth box supports the fourth box in that it specifies the Enabling Management Systems (EMS) that need to be in place to ensure that the MHC get built and maintained.) The glue that holds together the WTP <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">positioning</em> and the MHC/EMS <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">resources</em> is the middle box — How to Win (HTW), which is the theory as to how, in its chosen WTP, the company seeks to win and what MHC/EMS that it therefore must build to realize the fruits of that HTW theory.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7722" name="7722"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A Pox on Both Houses</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d1e2" name="d1e2">Silliness of the battle aside, I would note that I am not a fan of either school’s lack of attention to how one develops a winning strategy. Both theories are clear on what features the eventual strategy must have: for Porter/TPS it is a low cost or differentiation strategy and for RBV it is possession of VRIN resources. Yet both are also deafeningly silent on how one would transition from a state of having a strategy lacking those features to having one that possesses them. That is why I have spent so much mental energy and practice time on developing a process for upgrading from an inadequate strategy to a great one. It is something that is largely missing in strategy education. In the main, it focuses instead on teaching analytical frameworks — like five forces, VRIN, and myriad others — at the expense of teaching a process for creating strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a5aa" name="a5aa"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="75c4" name="75c4">The strategy practitioner problem resulting from this state of play is twofold. First, for the last couple of decades, strategy students have been dominantly taught that RBV is right and TPS is wrong, a classically false either/or choice. Second, they have increasingly been taught a proliferation of analytical tools, rather than how to create strategy, regardless of whether that strategy might be based on TPS or RBV. These are two central reasons why strategy is becoming the lost art in the real world of business.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c3b6" name="c3b6">If you a student in a strategy course at a business school, don’t get on the RBV hype-train. Ask your professor how it is you would know in advance, not after the fact, that you are investing in a valuable resource? And how you would use RBV to upgrade from an unsuccessful strategy to a successful one? If your professor simply repeats the characteristics of a great RBV/VRIN strategy and reiterates that RBV is a great model, explain that your questions haven’t been addressed, and keep asking until you get a better answer. It will be good for both you and your professor.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d643" name="d643">If you have graduated from business school into the business world and you present your boss with a VRIN analysis, don’t expect it to be greeted with excitement and enthusiasm. The business world isn’t particularly interested in tautological models that don’t help decisions get made because the business world cares more about effectiveness than what tenure stream strategy professors think. Get beyond the silly either/or academic battle and work on learning how to practice strategy in a way that helps you make real choices — which is, as I hope is obvious, the aim of this PTW/PI series.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="429d" name="429d">If as a manager, you receive a VRIN analyses of dubious utility from a subordinate, recognize that it is not your subordinate’s fault. It is just what your subordinate was taught as strategy gospel. Recognize that in the modern business world, most managers will have to learn strategy somewhere other than at business school and you will need to support your subordinates on that learning journey.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="dbe9" name="dbe9">I really wish that none of the above was the case. But I am afraid that, in the main, it is. While I can name exceptional strategy professors who teach exceptional strategy courses, they are the proverbial exception, not the rule. So as always, I believe that forewarned is forearmed.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Martin, 2021</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="810b" name="810b">A couple of weeks ago, I was asked by a Peruvian friend how to think about strategy in the face of the dramatic shift in his company’s operating environment due to the election of President Pedro Castillo, who is both avowedly Marxist and an admirer of Hugo Chávez’ controversial reign as President of Venezuela. It is analogous to a question I get frequently: “When do I know it is time to rethink my strategy?” So, I have decided to write my 50th Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights piece on Strategy in the Face of Discontinuity: To Do, or Not To Do?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e71a" name="e71a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Challenge</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1004" name="1004">In due course, nearly every company will face some sort of discontinuity. It could be a discontinuity in the business environment due to government change as with Peru. But equally, the discontinuity can occur due to the arrival of a new technology — the automobile, the transistor, the digital switch, the Internet. Or it can be a new type of business model — like the Uber, Airbnb, etc. peer-to-peer sharing platform. Or the arrival of a new competitor — as when GE Financial entered a variety of traditional leasing businesses or when Amazon enters yet another vertical.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e1a7" name="e1a7">It is difficult for a company facing one of these discontinuities to know how to respond. It doesn’t want to be in the position of acting as if the sky is falling and totally throwing out its strategy when that isn’t either necessary or productive. But equally, it doesn’t want to be the next Blockbuster and be written up as the ultimate case study in sticking your head in the sand until you die.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2bf5" name="2bf5">To do or not to do? Do you significantly alter your strategy, or do you stick it out with the current strategy? That is the question. But how do you know which is right for you? Unfortunately, there is no simple rule for what to do. It will always be a judgment call, but your friend in making that judgment is the question: what would have to be true? (Or WWHTBT for short)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="62ea" name="62ea"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Going Back to Your WWHTBT</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="76d8" name="76d8">I love the strategy question WWHTBT because it provides a snapshot of the logical architecture of your strategy. Think of WWHTBT as the blueprint of your house. It is difficult if not reckless to make meaningful renovations to your house without the blueprints because you won’t know which are retaining walls, where the plumbing goes, how the wiring is structured, etc.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="301f" name="301f">The WWHTBT blueprint should be a logical byproduct of strategy formulation. A key step in the strategy choice process is to lay out the WWHTBT for each possibility under consideration. The eventual strategy choice should be the possibility for which the WWHTBT are most true now and/or are within the company’s capacity to make true going forward. When the strategy choice has been made, it is imperative to retain the WWHTBT for the chosen strategy because tossing it away would be like tossing away the blueprint of your house after you have built it — which would be nuts!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4391" name="4391">In fact, you should use it daily. Before starting your work each day, you should check whether the WWHTBT that you put together at the time of your strategy choice still holds true. If it does, best thing to do is to keep on doing what you are doing. Don’t adjust the proverbial dials when your strategy logic still holds. But when a discontinuity hits, WWHTBT is even more important. It can help you figure out, metaphorically, whether the discontinuity just took out a load-bearing wall or only ripped a section of shingles off the roof. If it is the former, you know you need to redo your strategy because the WWHTBT just isn’t true anymore. If it is the latter, you may need to tweak it, but not start from scratch.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="16f2" name="16f2">It will always be a judgment call. But the WWHTBT will help you make that judgment. And if a strategy redo is called for, reviewing the WWHTBT is a great way to frame <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://roger-78069.medium.com/strategy-as-problem-solving-5c6fb9291d87" href="https://roger-78069.medium.com/strategy-as-problem-solving-5c6fb9291d87" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the problem to solve</a> with your next strategy effort.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4e09" name="4e09"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Working Through the WWHTBT Analysis</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8229" name="8229">It is important to assess each of the seven elements of the above strategy logic flow in forming your point of view on strategy change.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c4aa" name="c4aa"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Industry Analysis: Segmentation</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b979" name="b979">Think of this as the map of the market on which your current strategy is based. For example, does your map assume to be true that the segment of ‘natural’ products is so tiny that you can ignore it and just serve the ‘traditional’ part of the market? But does recent data show that this segment is growing faster than any other and has started to cause major shrinkage in the part of the map in which your strategy has chosen to compete? If so, does that mean your Where-to-Play (WTP) needs to shift before it is too late?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fdea" name="fdea"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Industry Analysis: Structural Attractiveness</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="43b4" name="43b4">This is your strategy’s assumption as to the profitability level earned by the average player in your WTP. Has that already worsened, or does it appear to be likely to worsen from the assumed level due to a macroeconomic change as with the Peru example, or because of the influx of low-cost international competitors, or because technology has made it easier for start-ups to compete? To what extent does the WWHTBT about structural attractiveness still hold true?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e485" name="e485"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Customer Value Analysis: Channel Value</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7463" name="7463">What does your strategy assume about what value the channel seeks from you? Has that changed in a way that makes your strategy less effective? For example, does your channel insist upon your loyalty to it while new competitors are going around that channel, whether GEICO, Dollar Shave Club or Tesla?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="63ef" name="63ef"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Customer Value Analysis: End-Consumer Value</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f83a" name="f83a">What does your strategy assume about what value end-consumers want from you? Are they demonstrating that they have changed how they value existing attributes or maybe value entirely new attributes? Perhaps you assumed that your taxi customers didn’t mind that their provider was largely unreliable, but Uber has demonstrated that they value much more than your strategy assumed knowing when their ride is actually going to show up. Similarly, do car owners value over-the-air software updates now that they know, thanks to Tesla, that they are possible? If customers’ definition of value has shifted, what does it mean for your existing value proposition?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f6a6" name="f6a6"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Analysis of Relative Position: Capabilities</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5b87" name="5b87">What does your strategy assume to be true about your capabilities relative to competition in your WTP? Has any competitor entered with better capabilities, whether Toyota’s elevated quality/reliability/durability (QRD), Amazon’s endless aisle, or Apple’s iTunes? If they have, what does it mean for your assumed competitive position?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bc8e" name="bc8e"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Analysis of Relative Position: Costs</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8c20" name="8c20">What does your strategy assume is true about your cost position relative to competition in your WTP? Has any competitor entered with a superior cost structure, whether with low-cost labor or a digital product or direct distribution or other means? If they have, what does it mean for your assumed competitive position?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f76e" name="f76e"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Competitor Analysis: Prediction</em></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f352" name="f352">This is, by the way, the most misunderstood element of the strategy logic flow. Most assume that it represents what you think competitors will do. Rather it is what you would have to believe about competitors in order for your strategy to work as you hope. For example, WWHTBT might be that your competitors won’t replicate your successful strategy because by doing so, they would cannibalize their current business.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8ec5" name="8ec5">So here the question is whether competitors (existing or new) have done something that you thought they couldn’t/wouldn’t do, which threatens your strategy? For example, CarMax and AutoNation might not have assumed a competitor like Carvana could enter with a unique model that threatens theirs. Or the credit card companies might not have assumed a competitor such as Apple Pay would threaten their strategies. If a competitor has, what does it mean for the sustainability of your assumed competitive position?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2443" name="2443"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Judgment Call</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="62d8" name="62d8">Based on your assessment of these seven components of your existing strategy’s WWHTBT, you need to make the judgment as to whether the WWHTBT elements collectively are still true enough to largely maintain course. If so, then tweak your strategy gently. The attraction of this course is that you can continue to utilize the current set of capabilities that you have built to accompany the strategy to compete successfully going forward.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="de47" name="de47">But you can’t allow sticking with the current strategy to become your default response just because it is the most convenient thing to do. You need to take a cold, hard look at the new reality through the lens of the seven WWHTBT elements. Are customers behaving just plain differently than we thought? Has our channel become an albatross? Is the cost structure of new competitors so much lower than ours that it doesn’t matter that customers like us more? For example, they will take a free offering over our offering. Did we count on Amazon/Google/Apple/Netflix not wanting to own our territory — but it turns out they do?</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9131" name="9131">Take all seven WWHTBT together and ask: am I willing to continue to bet the company’s future on these WWHTBT actually being true? If you can’t convince yourself to make that bet, then it is time to rethink your strategy from scratch. Otherwise, you will have given up your option of adjusting strategy proactively or at least before it is simply too late to make a difference.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5327" name="5327"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8116" name="8116">To my friend in Peru and everyone else who has asked me this question, I would say that this is a tough one. There is always the threat of anchoring on the current strategy. It is very tough to internalize that your current strategy no longer makes sense. And many companies have died the death of hoping against hope on this front.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c2bb" name="c2bb">That is why it is so important to be methodical about it. Use your existing WWHTBT as an aid to your judgment. It is the blueprint of your strategy house. Use it to stress test your strategy based on the new realities. Nobody can predict the future with certainty, so it isn’t your fault that you are facing a discontinuity. You can be faulted only if you ignore the discontinuity.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e501" name="e501">The exercise of revisiting your WWHTBT has a secondary benefit of helping to pinpoint the problem(s) that your new strategy must solve. If the WWHTBT for customers no longer holds, then you have a customer problem to solve with the new strategy. If it doesn’t hold for costs, then you have a cost problem to solve, and so on.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="2d38" name="2d38">The final insight I would share is that this exercise underscores how important it is to do WWHTBT in the first place. If you don’t do WWHTBT in service of making your prior strategy choice, you won’t have a reference point against which you can judge the degree to which the discontinuity does or does not undermine your strategy. In the same way that it is hard to know how far away from home you are if you don’t know where your home is, if you don’t have an accurate starting point for your strategy, it is easier to rationalize the discontinuity as not having made a big change to your strategy context.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>

Martin, 2021</figcaption></figure><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="7e74" name="7e74">Transformation is a hot topic these days, probably too hot. Putting transformation behind anything — finance transformation, go-to-market transformation, customer experience transformation, etc. — makes the thing sound cool and important. I have gotten so many questions about transformation that I thought I would dedicate my 51st Playing to Win/Practitioner Insights (PTW/PI) piece to Strategy &amp; Transformation: The Four Keys to Success. (Links for the rest of the PTW/PI series can be found <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" href="https://rogerlmartin.com/archive/medium-posts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a9e6" name="a9e6"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Un-Transformational Transformations</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="c6bf" name="c6bf">By my observation, most transformation efforts fail to transform. The AT&amp;T acquisition of Time Warner to transform AT&amp;T into a “converged media and communications company,” failed utterly and was unwound at a huge loss. The Bill Ackman/Ron Johnson attempt to transform JC Penney was an expensive flop. Marissa Mayer’s effort to transform Yahoo only transformed her from high tech darling to also-ran. And Jorma Ollila’s attempted transformation of Nokia at the inception of the smartphone era ended up sealing its fate as an irrelevant player in the business it previously dominated.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d239" name="d239">It is no surprise. Transformation is a challenging thing. It is a pretty dramatic word. It is not a gentle ‘improvement,’ ‘tweaking,’ ‘course correction,’ or ‘acceleration’ of the status quo. Transformation connotes a fundamental, discontinuous change — a revolution, a reboot, a makeover — otherwise we wouldn’t call it ‘transformation’ in the first place. In many respects, transformation is set up for disappointment.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="32f9" name="32f9"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">My Transformation Experience</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a535" name="a535">What then can improve the odds of overcoming the transformation challenge? I will use my personal experience from three transformations which either I led or with which I was intimately involved to illustrate what I feel are the four more generalizable keys to transformation success.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b5da" name="b5da">The first of the three is the most dramatic large corporate transformation that I can name. That is the transformation of the Thomson Corporation from being comprised of the world’s largest newspaper company, the world’s largest textbook publisher (tied with Pearson), Europe’s largest travel company, and a major player in North Sea oil to Thomson Reuters, the leading supplier of on-line, subscription-based must-have information, analytics, and workflow solutions to professionals. I served on the board of the company for 14 years during the heart of that transformation.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d8c3" name="d8c3">The second is an historic non-profit transformation. I served as board member of Tennis Canada for 12 years (including three years as chair) starting at the inception of its transformation from an utterly irrelevant tennis nation to what is now routinely characterized by on-air by commentators, including multiple Grand Slam champion John McEnroe, as a “tennis superpower.”</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e052" name="e052">The third is a transformation of an educational institution. I served as Dean of the Rotman School of Management for 15 years during which it was transformed from from the third best business school in southern Ontario to Canada’s only consequential global business school, with a faculty ranked as high as 3rd in the world in the Financial Times global ranking — after only Harvard Business School and the Wharton School.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="276b" name="276b"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Clear and Compelling Strategy</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f994" name="f994">A transformation can’t be a proliferation of initiatives or one big acquisition. These aren’t substitutes for strategy. Successful transformation has to be underpinned by a clear and compelling strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a079" name="a079">There must be a Winning Aspiration (WA). For Thomson, it was to become the leading provider of must-have information for professionals. For Tennis Canada, it was to become a leading tennis nation. For Rotman it was to become Canada’s first globally consequential business school.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6e53" name="6e53">Plus, there needs to be a clear Where-to-Play/How-to-Win (WTP/HTW) combination that serves and reinforces the WA. For Thomson, it was must-have data integrated into work flows of business, legal, accounting, finance, and scientific professionals. For Tennis Canada it was men’s and women’s singles (the most competitive part of the sport) and a unique hybrid of athlete development. For Rotman, it was a new way to think, relentless utility, and global scale.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9d1c" name="9d1c">You can’t set off with hope as your strategy or keep chasing the latest trend. There has to be a consistent, compelling vision of where you want the strategy to take you. But it needs to be flexible. Thomson eventually dropped financial and scientific professionals from its WTP. And Rotman absorbed design thinking and behavioral economics into its definition of a new way to think. The flexibility needs to maintain the robustness of the initial strategy rather than undermine it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="37db" name="37db"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Patience</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1b59" name="1b59">If you want a fast transformation, my advice is don’t even start. You will fail, which is one of the reasons why transformation by way of a single big acquisition is so likely to fail.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b7df" name="b7df">The Thomson transformation started in earnest with the 1989 sale of the first of its core businesses, oil &amp; gas, and wasn’t substantially complete until the sale of the fourth original business, textbooks in 2007. By that time Thomson was an all-digital, online player. There has been still more transformation since 2007, but the core transformation from newspaper/textbook publisher to on-line information provider to professionals took almost two decades.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6834" name="6834">At Tennis Canada, it took six years until first green shoots to appear with Filip Peliwo and Eugenie Bouchard winning Canada’s first <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Junior</em> Grand Slam singles championships in 2012. It took eight years to see Bouchard make the Women’s Wimbledon finals and Milos Raonic the Men’s semifinals both in 2014. And it took 13 years to achieve the stated goal of winning a Grand Slam singles championship when Bianca Andreescu won the US Open. Between 2014 and 2021, Canada was the only nation with both three different male and three different female Grand Slam semifinalists.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1671" name="1671">At the Rotman School, it took 15 years to double the student cohort, quadruple faculty, build a new building, and build our global reputation. That is one quarter of my working life. It was purposely slow and steady. I wanted to achieve complete transformation but without making our constituents so nervous that they would freak out at any point on the journey.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a315" name="a315"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Resilience</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d1aa" name="d1aa">All three transformations took withering criticism in the early days. The leadership group for a transformation needs to be tough-minded and supportive of each other throughout.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f0fe" name="f0fe">At Thomson, a critical step in the transformation was the purchase of West Publishing for $3.4 billion in 1996. The analyst community slammed Thomson for overspending and rashly betting the company. But the majority owner, Ken Thomson, backed management and ignored the criticism. Successive Vice-Chairs John Tory and Geoff Beattie were instrumental in ensuring that management pushed the transformation agenda that the majority owner sought and supported, even when it required very firm pushing!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1fd8" name="1fd8">At Tennis Canada, there was brutal criticism from former leading player and national head coach, Pierre Lamarche, who wrote an influential newsletter in which he blasted Tennis Canada strategy over and over for its new strategy that he guaranteed would fail. Long time Canadian Davis Cup coach Louis Cayer left for the UK when the new strategy was put in place. But the core group made up of the Chair, two key Board members (who became the next two chairs), and the CEO held firm to the strategy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3cbf" name="3cbf">At Rotman, one of most influential professors argued passionately and at length in the first Faculty Council discussion of the new strategy that it was going to be a disaster, a complete failure. Another leading professor resigned to go to a more prominent business school and wrote me a long letter explaining why I would be a certain failure and was a dreadful hire for the Dean’s job. Fortunately, I was supported by the University President who had my back, plus a loyal Vice-Dean Academic, and a supportive business community. Happily, the former professor came to my office seven years later to apologize and thank me for not listening to him. The latter professor wrote me letter offering to come back from the School that was no longer more prominent than Rotman. But by that point the faculty had improved so much that his academic area felt it could do better by using the faculty slot on someone better.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d8e2" name="d8e2"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Growth</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="73b1" name="73b1">Growth greases the skids of transformation. If your dominant mode is the reallocation of existing resources, you will create immediate enemies of every group from whom you take resources. If instead you grow the top line, you can put all the new resources behind the transformation and slowly scale back the things that don’t fit.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1fd4" name="1fd4">Thomson revenues were $5.1 billion in 1989 and had more than doubled to $12.7 billion at the time I left the board in 2013. Tennis Canada had $3 million/year to spend on high performance as of 2005 and within five years had grown its top line enough to be able to afford to spend $12 million/year. The Rotman budget in my 15th year as Dean was just shy of ten times the size of the budget that I inherited in my first year. In all three cases, the robust growth enabled the dedication of new resources to the key transformation initiatives.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4ff7" name="4ff7"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Practitioner Insights</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="eb1a" name="eb1a">If you are contemplating a transformation, whether leading one, supporting a leader of one, or advising on one, don’t call it a transformation. Transform rather than talk about transformation. Talk instead about the end state you seek. Very few people actually like what is involved in a transformation; they just like the end state. And I can assure you that calmness is better than agitation when you are transforming.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9860" name="9860">Then make sure to take a cold, hard look at whether you really have a strategy that can drive a transformation. Don’t be like AT&amp;T management with some vague and sloppy notion like we are going to transform into a vertically integrated “converged media and communications company” with “owner economics” and that is why it is worth paying $85 billion for Time Warner. My critique is not 20–20 hindsight. I was on the record at the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://fortune.com/2021/05/17/atts-warner-media-merger-hbo-warner-bros-discovery/" href="https://fortune.com/2021/05/17/atts-warner-media-merger-hbo-warner-bros-discovery/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">time</a> arguing that the acquisition would be a disaster, would end the career of CEO Randall Stephenson, would be sold within five years, and for consideration of half of the purchase price. I wasn’t quite right. It was a disaster, ended Stephenson’s career, was sold in three years, but I was off by $500 million. It sold for $43 billion, and I had predicted $42.5, my bad. Or JC Penney: I predicted that strategy-free debacle too.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4093" name="4093">Take the time to think very carefully through your strategy. Test it with others. Ask what would have to be true (WWHTBT). Make sure you have a plan for overcoming the key barriers. Don’t be AT&amp;T!</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a786" name="a786">Then determine whether you have the requisite patience. Assume that the desired transformation will take a decade. If it happens faster — hurrah. But don’t go into it thinking that it will happen quickly, or you will disappoint yourself and all the people whose expectations you raised. I read once that Allied prisoners of war in World War II Japanese prison camps tended to have one of three mindsets — and only one was helpful to their surviveal. The ones who despaired from inception tended to expire. The ones who believed that they would be liberated relatively quickly also expired when their hopes were dashed. The ones who survived believed that they were in for a long, difficult journey and steeled themselves for it. It is a good analogy for business transformations.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9b81" name="9b81">Then build a coalition that will help you achieve resilience. Assume that you will be told you are an idiot in the early years — and told so by important, influential people. You will need the support of others around you to get through the attacks, which happily will stop when momentum starts to build.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="d843" name="d843">Finally, have a growth plan. Only if you will have considerably more resources at the end of the transformation relative to the start is it even worth commencing. If the transformation involves shrinking first, don’t do it. Spend your precious life doing something else.</p></div></div></section>]]></content:encoded>
